ArrowRight Scientists said climate change helped shape the weather conditions that were causing misery and putting lives at risk from Mexico to Canada. There was no disputing the impact: If it wasn\u2019t way too smoky, it was way too hot.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019re used to the heat, but not to this degree,\u2019\u201d said Mayor Victor Trevi\u00f1o of Laredo, Tex., which recorded temperatures of 115 degrees last week, tying its all-time high. There were nine heat-related deaths, Webb County Medical Examiner Corinne Stern told county commissioners Monday, adding that \u201cI think our county was caught a little off-guard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Laredo and elsewhere in the South were caught off-guard by the heat, much of the rest of the country was getting an unexpected dose of horrendous air quality because of dense wildfire smoke rolling in from Canada. Air quality alerts related to the smoke were in effect for parts of some 17 states, covering nearly a third of the U.S. population.\n\nDetroit, Chicago and Minneapolis were among the cities with the worst air quality in the world Wednesday, according to IQAir. Unhealthy Code Red and Purple conditions stretched from eastern Iowa across Chicago and the lower Great Lakes region and toward the Appalachian Mountains, according to AirNow.gov.\n\n\u201cPoor air quality due to smoke from Canadian wildfires will continue through\u201d Thursday, the National Weather Service in Chicago wrote on Twitter. \u201cEveryone should avoid prolonged outdoor activities and those w/chronic respiratory issues should stay indoors if possible.\u201d\n\nSeveral U.S. cities were under air quality alerts on June 28 as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted from the Midwest to the East Coast. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nAn exceptionally rare Code Maroon was recorded in Decatur, Ill., during the midday. This is the worst level on the scale and considered hazardous. Chippewa, Ohio, was also reporting Code Maroon conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCities seeing Code Purple air quality Wednesday \u2014 very unhealthy, with an increased health risk for the general public \u2014 included Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Cedar Rapids in Iowa.\n\nForecasts for the smoke were changing, sometimes rapidly. After lingering in Code Orange territory on Wednesday, D.C., Maryland and Virginia were looking at more-dangerous Code Red conditions for Thursday, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments said on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBetween the wildfire smoke and the heat, \u201cYou get to pick your poison,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different things, but the common factor is climate change,\u201d Dessler said. \u201cHeat waves occur naturally, as do fires, but climate change makes the heat waves more intense and the fires more intense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch phenomena are likely only to worsen in years to come, but a gridlocked Congress has no plans to take action on climate beyond the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year. That leaves further efforts up to states, where approaches vary wildly. Some liberal states, particularly California, have moved aggressively to pass climate legislation, while conservative states such as Texas have taken little or no action.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a climate that didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d said Alice Hill, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, on Wednesday at a Washington Post Live event on extreme weather. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have what we need for a climate-worsened environment, and we are sorely behind in the land use choices, the building codes, the type of changes that would keep us much safer in a hotter, more dangerous world.\u201d\n\nRelief from the wildfire smoke and the Southern heat wave was on the horizon, but not for another several days.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Houston warned that heat indexes above 108 threatened into the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been thinking to yourself, \u2018Self, it\u2019s felt like a raging inferno for awhile \u2026 \u2019 Well, here\u2019s some reassurance that it has indeed been feeling spicy for what seems like an eternity. Heat Indices have been in the triple digits for most of June,\u201d the agency said Tuesday night on Twitter.\n\nAccording to tracking by The Washington Post, 59 million people in the United States were at risk of being exposed to dangerous heat on Wednesday, mostly in Texas and other Southern states, including Florida.\n\nOfficials in multiple cities pleaded with members of the public to stay indoors, conserve energy if possible and make use of cooling centers that were opening in public libraries in Dallas, Houston and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAnyone is at risk for a heat emergency this year because we have such high heat so early in the year,\u201d David Persse, chief medical officer for the Houston Health Department, said Wednesday in an interview on NBC affiliate station KPRC2 in Houston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreliminary figures from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the grid serving most of the state, indicated that demand between 5 and 6 p.m. Tuesday exceeded the previous record set in July 2022.\n\nSan Antonio Fire Department spokesman Woody Woodward said there had been a 53 percent increase in heat-related calls so far this June, compared with the same time period a year ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever recall seeing it so many consecutive days that it feels like 110, 112 and 114,\u201d Woodward said in an interview.\n\nNumerous temperature records have been broken in Texas since the heat wave began more than three weeks ago.\n\nTemperatures have routinely topped 100 degrees across much of the state, including in Rio Grande Village in southwest Texas near the Mexico border, which reached an all-time high of 118 degrees. In Corpus Christi, the heat index reached a blistering 125 degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat would expand from Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley and mid-South through Thursday.\n\nExcessive heat warnings and heat advisories were in effect Wednesday across parts of 14 states. The hottest zone Wednesday stretched from Central Texas northward through central Oklahoma into southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri, where many locations were expecting high temperatures at least 10 to 15 degrees above normal.\n\nTemperatures were forecast to reach near or past 100 degrees across much of Texas, southern New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana on Wednesday through Friday, with heat indexes climbing as high as 110 to 120 degrees.\n\nDangerous heat was expected to expand deeper into Missouri, Mississippi, Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle on Thursday, and into Georgia this weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany areas outside of Texas will experience their most significant heat of the season,\u201d the National Weather Service said in a summary of key messages about the heat wave. \u201cIncreased heat-related danger persists this week due to the longevity of this ongoing heat wave with record high nighttime lows and elevated heat index readings during the day. It is essential to have ways to cool down and limit your heat exposure.\u201d\n\nForecasters said the heat dome \u2014 a large high pressure zone that traps heat underneath it \u2014 responsible for the heat wave is expected to weaken late this weekend into next week, which should allow temperatures to trend a bit cooler during the week of July Fourth.\n\nBut if the South is in line for a letup, other places may get hit instead. After months of relatively cool temperatures, California was set to face its first major heat wave of the season, with triple-digit temperatures threatening the state\u2019s Central Valley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exceptionally wet winter California enjoyed has seeped into the soil and plant life, counteracting fire risk somewhat, officials said. At the same time, the record snowpack has produced swift currents in area rivers, leading the Weather Service to caution residents to be careful about trying to cool off in local bodies of water, many of which also remain frigid after the cold winter.\n\nIan Livingston and Matthew Cappucci contributed to this report.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/smoke-map-air-quality-wildfires/": "Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript.

For this time of year, \u201cwhat\u2019s maybe unusual is the size of the fires and how far the smoke traveled,\u201d said Brett Palm, a scientist who specializes in atmospheric chemistry at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \u201cFor the smoke to be as dense as it was this far away, it has to be a large fire.\u201d\n\n[Why wildfire smoke is bad for your health]\n\nAcross North America, wildfires are burning more land at a higher intensity, a phenomenon that wildfire experts attribute to climate change. Studies show a clear correlation between the number of acres burned by wildfires and higher temperatures. Heat waves in May in Alberta dried out vegetation, creating conditions that make large wildfires more likely.\n\nHow bad was the wildfire smoke where you live? Enter a city Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill./Ind./Wis.\n\nTo isolate the impact of smoke on air quality from other pollutants, researchers at Stanford University\u2019s Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab analyzed air quality measurements from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s more than 2,400 air monitoring stations. If a station recorded high levels of air pollution and satellite imagery showed smoke plumes near a sensor during that same time, researchers attributed anomalous pollution to smoke.\n\nSmoke\u2019s impact on air quality depends on the amount of smoke a fire produces, which affects the density and size of plumes. The larger the smoke plume, the farther the smoke can travel. In May, the wind blew smoke from fires in Canada\u2019s western and central provinces southeast and along the Rocky Mountains.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nTwo thousand miles away from the wildfires in Alberta, Denver residents experienced over a week of smoky skies and air pollution alerts. Dense smoke traveled downwind and created a spike in small particulate matter until \u201ca front came through and brought clean air out of the mountains,\u201d said Palm. \u201cYou could see in Boulder, the smoke got flushed right out of the area and the air was clean.\u201d\n\n[Here's what to know about the Canadian wildfires affecting parts of the U.S.]\n\nSmall air particles, or PM2.5, are particulate matter small enough to travel beyond the barriers in the nose and enter the respiratory system and bloodstream. The particles can cause inflammation in the lungs, exacerbating symptoms for people with respiratory conditions, or dislodge plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of stroke.\n\nIn Bismarck, the daily average of PM2.5 rose to more than 200 micrograms per cubic meter \u2014 the area\u2019s highest one-day average on record. When levels of small particulate matter are that high, otherwise healthy people with no underlying conditions can start experiencing more serious health impacts, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe smoke in Bismarck was so dense that it reduced visibility to a quarter of a mile.\n\n\u201cIt came over the top of the building like a white, smoky cloud and just inundated us for a day and a half,\u201d said Ryan Mills, an ambient air monitoring manager for the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here my whole life and never saw it that bad, that thick.\u201d\n\nA low-pressure system brought the smoke to the ground and condensed it, Mills said, which created high concentrations of PM2.5.\n\nIn May, cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and D.C. experienced lower levels of air pollution over a longer period of time.\n\nNeelima Tummala, a clinical assistant professor of surgery at GW Medical Faculty Associates and co-director of the Climate Institute at George Washington University, said the early-season smoke along the East Coast caught her by surprise.\n\n[How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke]\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Tummala said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m thinking about how do I think about heat, getting my patients prepared for July and August, and all the sudden, I started seeing these things about wildfire smoke.\u201d\n\nSometimes, smoke causes air to look hazy, but Tummala said air pollution is often invisible to the naked eye, which is why it is important to check local air quality measurements. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about, \u2018Oh, this is a day where the air quality is poor, I need to be more cognizant, maybe make sure I\u2019m traveling with my asthma inhaler.\u2019\u201d\n\nMarshall Burke, an associate professor at Stanford University\u2019s Doerr School of Sustainability who researches smoke pollution, said there is no \u201csafe\u201d level of small particulate matter or wildfire smoke exposure.\n\n\u201cWe see impacts basically starting at zero,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe overall story is that more is bad.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nSmoke-filled air is particularly dangerous for people with underlying respiratory conditions and some studies suggest that fine particulate matter from wildfires is more harmful than air pollution from other sources. Increased levels of wildfire smoke in recent years are slowing or reversing clean air progress in states across the country, according to Stanford research.\n\nWhen the air quality is poor, Tummala recommends wearing an N95 mask outside and limiting smoke exposure for pets. And while it\u2019s important to limit exposure to smoke, \u201cdo I also want people to be outdoors exercising and doing good things for their mental and physical health? Yes,\u201d she said. The most important thing is for people to listen to their bodies, because \u201ceveryone has slightly different responses to environmental irritants.\u201d", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/06/28/aging-green-spaces-nature-health/": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWant to live longer? Living near more green spaces could be part of the answer. A study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances suggests that if you have long-term exposure to more greenery where you live, on average you may be adding 2.5 years to your life.\n\nThe paper adds to existing knowledge of the health benefits of living around greenery by shedding more light on how nature can affect our bodies. The researchers looked at long-term exposure to surrounding green spaces and how that affected biological aging among a group of more than 900 people in four U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that being near green space caused some biological or molecular changes that can be detected in our blood,\u201d said Lifang Hou, a preventive medicine professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine and the study\u2019s principal investigator.\n\nHow nature can \u2018get under our skin\u2019\n\nTo explore the association between long-term exposure to greenery and aging, the researchers compared age-related biological changes in the study\u2019s participants over a 20-year period against data on green spaces near where those people live. Using blood DNA, they were able to measure biological age at a molecular level by analyzing small changes in how genes related to the aging process work, Hou said.\n\nIf a person\u2019s biological age, which can be sped up or slowed down depending on how they live, is older than their chronological age, they may be at higher risk for developing age-related health conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease or Alzheimer\u2019s, she said.\n\nBiological age \u201creally depends on what we do daily,\u201d including what we eat and how physically active we are, Hou said. The study, however, emphasizes that it\u2019s not only about what each person individually does for their own health, but also their neighborhoods and communities, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know the benefits of green space in reducing premature mortality,\u201d said David Rojas-Rueda, an epidemiology professor at Colorado State University who has studied the health benefits of vegetation but was not involved in the latest paper.\n\n\u201cThis study explains how this could happen by describing how green spaces can modify how genes are expressed,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first studies that really kind of demonstrates how exposure to nature, living in greener areas, may get under our skin and lead to these kinds of fundamental changes to these biomarkers of aging,\u201d added Peter James, an environmental epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies nature and health but who was not involved in the research.\n\nMore research needed\n\nTo assess green spaces, the researchers used satellite imaging and applied a widely accepted measure of quantifying vegetation, said Kyeezu Kim, the study\u2019s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. Kim added that they also identified major parks near the participants\u2019 homes. While that helped identify the location and quantity of plant life, the approach does not provide details about the type \u2014 for example, whether the area is a golf course or a forested nature trail \u2014 or quality of green space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have this vegetation data, but it tells us very little about what the active ingredients in nature are that influence health,\u201d James said. \u201cIt just tells you the quantity of vegetation in a given area around your home.\u201d\n\nKnowing more details about the green spaces studied and what people might be doing in them is critical, said Karen Seto, director of the Hixon Center for Urban Ecology at the Yale School of the Environment.\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t know what type of green space it is, I think for cities, they don\u2019t know is it sufficient just to plant a bunch of street trees?\u201d said Seto, who did not contribute to the new study.\n\nThe study also left other unanswered questions, such as why the rate of biological aging did not appear to be the same across race, gender and socioeconomic status. For example, the researchers observed Black people who had more access to green space were only about 1 year younger in biological age compared with the study\u2019s average 2.5 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts said more studies are needed to pinpoint how people might benefit from greenery and what other social determinants that could be involved.\n\nA dose of greenery\n\nIn the meantime, the research should encourage people to think more about their surroundings when making healthy living decisions, in addition to diet, sleep and exercise, Hou said.\n\nThe study should also serve as motivation for policymakers to incorporate nature into people\u2019s daily lives, James said.\n\n\u201cWe need to start changing our perspective on green space and really viewing it as an essential piece of infrastructure, just the same as sewer systems and garbage collection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that we require as human beings to thrive, to be healthy.\u201d\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/06/27/concrete-greenhouse-gas-emissions-cement/": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nLet\u2019s do a quiz: After water, what is the most-used material in the world? Is it steel? Wood? Aluminum? Plastic? The answer, it turns out, is concrete. Concrete, a blend of water, sand, gravel and cement, has helped build everything from the Roman Pantheon to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. We walk on concrete, drive on it, live in it. According to one estimate, more of the planet\u2019s mass is locked up in concrete than it is all of the planet\u2019s trees, bushes and shrubs.\n\nAnd making all that concrete also emits an enormous amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nThis is thanks to cement, effectively the chemical \u201cglue\u201d that holds all the components of concrete together. \u201cConcrete is the cake, and cement is the flour,\u201d said Randolph Kirchain, the co-director of the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub. Although cement is only about 10 percent of concrete by mass, it makes up the lion\u2019s share of concrete\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nThe most common type of cement in the world is Portland cement, which is made from limestone. (It is named after the British Isle of Portland, not the city in Oregon.) Baked in a giant kiln at very high temperatures \u2014 think around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 limestone transforms into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. That calcium oxide, or lime, is a key ingredient in the cement that holds our bridges, apartment buildings and roads together.\n\nThat process produces a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. Not only does the carbon dioxide from the reaction spill into the atmosphere, but cement producers also use huge amounts of coal or natural gas to heat the kiln.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, the cement industry generates 8 percent of global carbon emissions \u2014 triple the emissions of the aviation industry.\n\n\u201cYou make about a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement,\u201d said Eric Toone, technical lead at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which invests in emerging low-carbon cement technologies.\n\nSome producers are slowly trying to implement solutions. One option is simply making concrete with less cement. Hessam AzariJafari, the deputy director of the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub, says producers can substitute fly ash \u2014 a product of coal combustion \u2014 or waste from steel production instead of limestone. These materials can also help bind concrete together without the need for copious amounts of Portland cement. Today, around 11 to 23 percent of concrete\u2019s \u201cbinder\u201d is made from these other materials; experts estimate that in future, it could reach 50 or even 80 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther, more radical changes are also possible. Some start-ups are experimenting with a completely new chemistry for cement that doesn\u2019t include calcium carbonate. The California-based start-up Brimstone is working on a recipe that involves calcium silicate instead; the resulting chemical reaction doesn\u2019t release carbon dioxide and can be cooked at a lower kiln temperature. Other companies, including Canadian start-up CarbonCure, are working on injecting and storing CO2 into concrete itself.\n\nBut progress is slow. Concrete is a crucial component in modern construction; changing its ingredients poses not only an engineering problem but also a regulatory and safety problem. When it comes to innovating in the concrete industry, \u201ceverybody wants to be third,\u201d Toone said. In the United States, many individual states have their own specifications for how concrete should be made and with what materials; changing the ingredients of concrete will mean a painful regulatory overhaul.\n\nThose standards exist for good reasons. \u201cMany of these things are safety-critical,\u201d Kirchain said. But to clean up one of the most carbon-polluting industries in the world, some of the rules will have to change.\n\nThat\u2019s partly why many previous attempts to green concrete have failed: Promising start-ups have run out of money or failed to find a market for their products.\n\nKirchain says there is a way to cut carbon emissions significantly and ensure safety at the same time. And that will be critical to the coming transition. \u201cThe things that concrete goes into are things that we need to last,\u201d he said.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/27/new-plant-based-meat-developing-rubisco-duckweed/": "Climate Coach The plant protein that could push meat off your plate Duckweed at the Plantible Foods aqua farm in San Marcos, Calif.

At the moment, it looks more like a meth lab out of the drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d jokes Tony Martens Fekini, the chief executive of Plantible Foods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecrepit recreational vehicles squat on the property. In one corner, people tend to vials, grow lights and centrifuges in a trailer lab. More than a dozen big ponds filled with duckweed, a tiny green plant, bask in the Southern California sunshine.\n\nBut the only thing cooking here is protein.\n\nWithin each tiny floating aquatic plant is a molecule colloquially called rubisco. Without it, most life on Earth would cease to exist.\n\nPlants use rubisco protein \u2014 technically known as Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase \u2014 as the catalyst for photosynthesis, combining CO2 from the air with the building blocks for sugars and carbohydrates composing the base of our food chain.\n\nRubisco is arguably the most abundant protein on the planet. Every green leaf has it. But this tireless molecule is locked inside plants\u2019 cells, spoiling almost as soon as it comes into contact with the outside world. At the moment, eating salads is the only way to consume much of it.\n\nBut Plantible\u2019s farm may change that. If it succeeds, duckweed may become humanity\u2019s first new major crop in more than a century, a skeleton key to unlock how plants replace animal protein on an unprecedented scale.\n\nRubisco doesn\u2019t just provide the protein we crave. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most versatile proteins, shape-shifting into forms resembling egg whites, meat, milk, gluten or even steak \u2014 all extracted from leaves. If we can harvest enough, it may elevate plants from a side dish to the main course \u2014 and as I found, it tasted delicious.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in.\n\nProtein problem\n\nThe world grows more than enough food to feed everyone on Earth. Much of it goes to livestock. About half of the corn and soybeans grown in the United States are fed to cows, pigs and chickens to support meat-rich diets.\n\nAdvising people to eat less of it isn\u2019t likely to do much. In country after country, as incomes rise, meat consumption follows virtually in lockstep.\n\nThat comes at a steep cost to ecosystems and the climate. Meat, at least how most of it is raised today, is the driver behind 57 percent of all food production emissions. The Stockholm Environment Institute estimates current livestock production methods make it virtually impossible to prevent global warming from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and difficult to avoid a 2-degree increase.\n\nThe challenge, then, is not to persuade people to eat more vegetables. It\u2019s how to make plant proteins taste better than their animal counterparts.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed like \u201calternative meat\u201d might succeed. Highfliers like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, after seeing sales soar in 2020, have faltered. Retail sales of alt-meat dropped more than 10 percent in 2022 amid health questions and high prices. Plant-based milk, while stealing market share from traditional dairy, still accounts for just 9 percent of the volume sold in the United States. Dreams of dethroning Big Meat are out, at least for now.\n\nThe problem, in part, is known to anyone who has stirred protein powder into a smoothie, eaten a vegan brownie or bitten into an Impossible burger. Plant proteins aren\u2019t a perfect substitute. They can impart grainy textures, \u2018vegetal\u2019 off-flavors or fall short of the savory appeal of eggs, dairy and meat.\n\nSo food producers are searching for the holy grail of plant proteins, one that combines the best of plant and animal proteins: affordable, abundant and easy to grow, with the physical properties that make a hamburger or milkshake so alluring.\n\nRubisco might just be it.\n\nRubisco: The \u2018ideal\u2019 protein?\n\nFor more than 200 years, we\u2019ve known leaves contain the protein. But rubisco\u2019s most remarkable qualities have only come to light through modern science.\n\nRubisco\u2019s composition is a nearly \u201cideal\u201d protein for humans, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, boasting an amino acids profile rivaling egg whites or casein in milk. Unlike the most common plant protein in soy, wheat and peas, it offers a non-allergenic, easily digestible and complete set of all nine essential amino acids our body can\u2019t produce on its own.\n\nIn contrast to alt-meats, rubisco is a versatile shape-shifter on the human palate. Thanks to its molecular structure, it can bind, emulsify, foam or gel. In baked goods, the protein mimics the luscious mouthfeel of butter and eggs, or the springy bounce of gluten. As a binder in plant-based meats, it retains the delicious bite of a juicy burger. In a fluffy omelet or whipped meringue, it replicates the function of eggs.\n\n\u201cRubisco does live up to a lot of the hype,\u201d says Grant Pearce, a protein chemistry researcher at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.\n\nThe problem, however, has been getting it out of the leaf. As soon as a leaf is cut, its compounds bind to rubisco, rendering it unusable as a food ingredient. At the industrial scale, harvesting rubisco has proved to be a formidable challenge.\n\n\u201cYou just have to process the plant material reasonably quickly so you don\u2019t end up with a brown sludge,\u201d says Pearce. Sugar beet leaves, cauliflower, kale, broccoli stems, radishes and even invasive plant species have all been harvested as protein sources. None proved economical.\n\nAnd some are skeptical it will ever be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just economics,\u201d says Arnold Bloom, a professor of plant sciences at the University of California at Davis. Even at high concentrations, such as in spinach, rubisco represents just a tiny percentage of the plant\u2019s biomass. Harvesting it efficiently is a tall order. Its role as a major protein source, he predicts, will be \u201cnegligible.\u201d\n\nBut for Fekini, a former agricultural commodities trader, all roads led to a neglected little plant most people associate with pond scum.\n\nA duckweed factory\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a literal weed,\u201d says Fekini, 34, as we stare at the minuscule green plants swirling at our feet.\n\nDuckweed, or lemna, doesn\u2019t get much respect in most of the world. While eaten in parts of Southeast Asia, the pond vegetation is regarded as a nuisance elsewhere. That reputation belies the plant\u2019s remarkable biology.\n\n\u201cEveryone who learns about lemna, there is a special place in their heart,\u201d says Patrick Shih, a plant bioengineering expert at UC-Berkeley. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what inspired Fekini and his co-founder Maurits van de Ven to transport about 100 duckweed strains to Plantible\u2019s R&D laboratory in California. Here, workers test different varieties and select the most promising strains. They tweak the environmental conditions, sample rubisco concentrations and pick the winners. Then the process begins again.\n\nIt\u2019s what terrestrial farmers have been doing for millennia, a process that traditionally takes years, if not decades, to refine. Lemna\u2019s prodigious growth means strains can be selected and improved in weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to create version 2.0 of agriculture,\u201d says Fekini. \u201cWe need to develop better tool kits, and the only way is to start from scratch, create better ingredients and tap into novel plants. But it\u2019s definitely not the easiest route.\u201d\n\nIf he succeeds, duckweed may be one of humanity\u2019s first new major crops in more than a century, since soybeans introduced from China spread globally during the 1900s. Today, just four crops \u2014 wheat, rice, corn and soybeans \u2014 supply two-thirds of human calories.\n\nWith global warming promising punishing conditions for today\u2019s crops, the world needs a new, resilient option to protect the food supply against shocks, says Shih. \u201cTo jump to another species that hasn\u2019t even been domesticated, you open the door to a whole new design space that is intrinsically different than row crops,\u201d he says. \"But scaling this up is one of the hardest things to do.\u201d\n\nScaling it up\n\nAs we stand in the humid greenhouse in Southern California, a lazy river of duckweed floats past. This is Plantible\u2019s pilot farm: more than a dozen cement ponds, each covered with a luxuriant mat of lemna. Whooshing pumps and a paddle wheel keep the water flowing. Greenhouses keep temperatures balmy. Machinery sits ready to harvest the duckweed.\n\nI note it\u2019s all a rather low-tech way to grow the future of protein. That\u2019s by design, counters Fekini. \u201cOur philosophy has always been finding that balance,\u201d he says. \u201cAgriculture is generally low-tech because low-tech is highly scalable and very affordable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make rubisco in meaningful quantities, Plantible will need to extract it more efficiently than ever before.\n\nThe challenge is that while rubisco is abundant globally, the molecule only represents about 1 percent of a leaf by weight. That means processing enormous amounts of biomass to obtain a relatively small amount of protein. Pearce, at the University of Canterbury, estimates 1 metric ton of leaves yields about 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of rubisco, at least on land. If you\u2019re competing against animal protein selling for about $5 per pound, on average, it\u2019s difficult to turn a profit.\n\nBut Plantible, backed by Kellogg\u2019s, among other investors, says it has two advantages. The first is productivity. Unlike a field, lemna can grow happily in a few inches of water, year-round, in environments perfectly calibrated to maximize growth. Almost all the water is reclaimed during harvest, and fertilizer demands are modest. Scale also works in its favor.\n\nPlantible\u2019s new Texas facility, an old Black Angus cattle ranch, is 50 times larger than its California site. Fekini estimates ponds on the 100-acre site can produce 36 metric dry tons per hectare \u2014 roughly 10 times more than soy.\n\nPlantible\u2019s other advantage, it argues, is the company\u2019s ability to do everything under one roof, from selecting the plants to processing rubisco. By managing every step, it claims it can turn duckweed into protein with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nThat has yet to be proved. But in May, I watched a pond full of lemna turn into a white powder ready for baked goods within a few hours. The plants were harvested and macerated, producing the equivalent of a green smoothie. The slurry was spun in a massive centrifuge, leaving a bright green juice with the aroma of a freshly cut lawn. The rubisco was dried and stored.\n\nAt the end of the process, I was handed a bag of fine white powder, almost like flour that I was promised would make delicious cookies.\n\nHow does it taste?\n\nWhen I stirred rubisco into a glass of water, it tasted like nothing at all. The powder dissolved completely, leaving it only slightly more viscous than before. As an industrial food ingredient, that\u2019s the point. The colorless, flavorless all-purpose protein can serve specific needs depending on who\u2019s using it.\n\nFor now, Plantible is marketing a replacement for eggs in industrial baking. It will show up in macarons by Sweet Maresa\u2019s starting next month. The New York bakery will later roll other baked goods, like muffins, cakes and cookies, made with Plantible\u2019s rubisco.\n\nSince most consumer packaged goods companies are trying to remove expensive, unreliable ingredients \u2014 eggs have seen repeated shortages and price spikes \u2014 Plantible is positioning rubisco as a superior substitute for dairy and eggs.\n\nIts second product targets alt-meat manufacturers. Since it binds with fats and oils, the protein can produce a plant-based burger that cooks, tastes and feels closer to the real thing without fats leaking out of the patty. Plantible says it has already begun experimenting with rubisco in plant-based sausages, chicken, fish and even steak.\n\nThe money to commercialize rubisco is pouring in. Pearce estimates that more was spent last year on developing rubisco than in the previous 20 years combined.\n\nIf it works, the photosynthetic molecule may succeed where other alt-meats have faltered, unlocking the market potential of other plant proteins like soy, peas and other legumes, by making them more palatable for people who prefer eating meat.\n\nFor that to happen, rubisco\u2019s promoters must pass the most difficult test: Your taste buds.\n\nBrock Kuhlman, a trained chef who also holds a Ph.D. in food chemistry, sweeps out of Plantible\u2019s test kitchen carrying a platter piled high with baked goods. As a crowd gathered in Plantible\u2019s R&D facility, the company\u2019s senior food scientist whipped up an array of chewy chocolate chip cookies, pound cake and peaky macaroons, still warm from the oven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of eggs and butter, Kuhlman says, each one was prepared with rubisco. They look moist and delectable. I bite into one, and then another. After savoring all of them, I search my palate for something missing. I can\u2019t find it. The experience of each bite replicates the rich, soft springiness of the best baked goods.\n\nI mention I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re so hard to resist.\n\n\u201cNo one will sacrifice their taste buds to save the planet,\u201d says Fekini as we clear the plate, leaving only crumbs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about taste. People aren\u2019t compromising on taste because of the cool technology behind it. Consumers are ruthless.\u201d", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/24/texas-heat-wave-power-grid/": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBut Texas is uniquely vulnerable to power failures because it cannot draw electricity from neighbors in a crisis. It is the only state in the contiguous United States disconnected from the national grid, a deliberate move to avoid federal regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNext week is going to be the real test,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cJust about every single air conditioner in those regions is going to want energy at the same time.\u201d\n\nState officials are increasingly turning to an unexpected technology: giant batteries.\n\nThese Mack truck-size systems, which can quickly spew stored electrons onto the grid when power plants sputter, played a crucial role in avoiding outages over the past week, as scorching temperatures shattered records across Texas. And they are renewing debate about the role of clean energy in stabilizing the Texas grid, as the batteries are ideal for harnessing wind and solar energy.\n\nPower system operators across the country are watching closely to see how Texas manages this crisis. While the perilous combination of prolonged triple-digit temperatures and overstressed power plants and transmission lines is plaguing Texas at the moment, it could hit most regions at any time. Changes in the weather and the deteriorating condition of regional power grids make the entire nation increasingly vulnerable to outages for longer stretches of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTexas is experiencing what everyone in the country is going to be going through in some form or fashion in the years ahead,\u201d said Aaron Zubaty, the CEO of Eolian, which owns and operates large energy storage projects. \u201cAll the systems are not necessarily designed for operating in these types of prolonged events at the edge of design and engineering specifications. \u2026 These are the types of weather events that can cause weird things to occur that no one has ever thought about at all types of plants.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that \u201coppressive and persistent heat will become increasingly dangerous and potentially deadly\u201d in much of Texas, and that many areas of the state \u201chave already experienced a yearly record number of hours of dangerously high heat index reading.\u201d\n\nThat scorching weather is expected to stretch into next week, with the service cautioning that the length of the heat wave threatens to make it particularly deadly. Cities across Texas are reporting the shattering of high temperature records. At the San Angelo airport, the thermometer hit 114 degrees by midweek, surpassing the record \u2014 set only a year ago \u2014 by three degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe high temperatures are compounded by thick humidity, intensifying the impact and health risk. It keeps the heat trapped in buildings that might otherwise cool down overnight, leaving them still baking when the sun comes up in the morning and temperatures soar anew.\n\nAcross the border in Mexico, the situation appears even more dire. The country\u2019s power grid is on the brink as temperatures soared well past 100 degrees in multiple regions. Several deaths have been reported, according to local news reports, which also relayed that people were sleeping out in the street in the town of Huetamo, where power outages persisted for days.\n\nIn Texas, the grid so far has held despite heat more extreme than many parts of the state have ever faced.\n\nThe outsize role battery storage is playing in keeping the power on is welcome news to clean energy companies, which have been fighting the fossil fuel lobby\u2019s efforts to place blame for the state\u2019s electricity woes on the increasing share of renewables in its energy mix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBattery storage is a boon to wind and solar, as it allows them to capture and store the energy created at times when it may not be needed and then make it available to ratepayers at peak hours.\n\nBut amid this heat emergency, batteries have also proved useful in bailing out more traditional power plants.\n\nWhen a large coal facility got knocked offline during peak hours this week amid the stress of the extreme heat, energy that was being stored in batteries elsewhere in Texas was quickly dispatched to carry the grid through the evening. The batteries were also crucial to keeping the power on when a nuclear plant hiccuped and went offline earlier in the week, said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant.\n\nThe power grid quickly becomes vulnerable to outages when a plant is unexpectedly knocked offline. The batteries, much like small, fast-reacting gas generators, are able to backstop that electricity immediately. That kind of backup power was not available in Texas in 2021, when winter storm Uri caused multiple power plants to fail, leaving millions of Texans freezing in the dark for days in one of the largest blackouts in recent U.S. history. At least 246 people died during that storm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas has since become a national leader in battery storage, with nearly a third of the nation\u2019s capacity, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Only California has more. Texas plans to nearly double the amount of battery storage on its grid within the next year, Lewin said.\n\nThe proliferation of such storage is likely to drive wind and solar development in the state even during a time the technologies are under siege in the Texas Capitol.\n\n\u201cA lot of this storage is coming online as kind of an insurance policy in case something breaks,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBut once it is on the system, it can do more than just help us during emergencies. It can help support renewables.\u201d\n\nWind and solar energy, Rhodes said, can be packed into the batteries when the sun is pounding and the wind is howling but demand for electricity is low, and then sold to ratepayers when they need it. The battery units are coming online at the same time Texas is vastly expanding its use of solar power, with the state on track this summer to surpass California in production of electricity from utility-scale solar farms.\n\n\u201cIt is a particularly good thing to have on the Texas grid,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cIt lets us harness for energy that same sun that is overheating our buildings and driving so much demand for electricity to cool them down.\u201d\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/25/tonga-volcano-eruption-lightning-record-study/": "Lightning flashed in the ash cloud of the Tonga volcano when it erupted on Jan. 14, 2022. (Video: Tonga Geological Services)\n\nListen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nLike crime scene investigators, scientists are retracing what exactly happened on Jan. 15, 2022, near the Tonga archipelago in the South Pacific. At the time, the bare facts were obvious: An underwater volcano erupted, and it was enormous. Since then, scientists keep making remarkable discoveries about what turned out to be one of the world\u2019s most powerful volcanic eruptions.\n\n\u201cIt was clear right away that this was going to be a showstopping scientific event,\u201d said Alexa Van Eaton, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey. \u201cIt\u2019s several orders of magnitude larger than anything we\u2019re used to looking at. \u2026 This eruption clearly was going to teach us something new.\u201d\n\nThe climactic awakening of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u02bbapai submarine volcano lasted less than a day and took the lives of a handful of people, including as far away as Peru.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volcano has already broken several records: The powerful blast was bigger than any U.S. nuclear explosion. Tsunami waves overwhelmed shores. Ash flew up into the third layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, higher than any other recorded volcanic eruption. An unprecedented amount of water, enough to fill nearly 60,000 Olympic-size swimming pools of water, shot up in the atmosphere and could warm our atmosphere in the future.\n\nNow, a new study led by Van Eaton reveals more details of this puzzling event by analyzing lightning data. Researchers found the plume created its own massive weather system \u2014 and the most intense lightning storm ever recorded.\n\nAt least 2,600 lightning bolts each minute were detected during peak activity, shattering rates from any other weather system, storm or volcanic eruption recorded in Earth\u2019s history. Using the data, the team also determined that the eruption lasted for 11 hours, several hours longer than previously estimated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVan Eaton said the ash cloud from the eruption obscures the region around the volcano, even using satellites in space.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t drill down through the cloud and see what\u2019s going on at the event,\u201d Van Eaton said. \u201cLightning can help us do that \u2026 we were able to basically match up the lightning rates with the plume height to reconstruct the timeline of the Jan. 15 activity.\u201d\n\nThe intense eruption lodged volcanic material and ash 36 miles high, a world record. Van Eaton said that momentum from the fragmentation of the magma drove a strong upward current of air at the ground level, which is typically seen in thunderstorms. Volcanoes are known to create their own weather system like this, but she said \u201cthis was on another level\u201d and created intense lightning.\n\nLightning in volcanoes isn\u2019t new. Lightning is caused by an imbalance of electrical charges in the atmosphere. In volcanoes, ash particles scraping against one another, along with hail and ice-forming processes, can electrify airborne particles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt may be that larger particles were going one direction and smaller particles were going in another, and that helped create the charge separation that leads to electrical discharges,\u201d Van Eaton said.\n\nNearly 200,000 lightning flashes were detected in the volcanic plume during the entire eruption, according to ground and satellite sensors. Some of the lightning occurred between 12 and 19 miles above sea level, the highest-altitude flashes on record. The lightning also appeared in ring formations expanding and contracting around the center of the volcano, which the authors had not seen before.\n\nAt the peak of the eruption, half of the lightning detected around the globe at the time was occurring at the volcano, said co-author Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist and lightning data expert. The peak lightning rate \u2014 2,600 lightning bolts in a minute \u2014 was more than eight times higher than the next highest volcanic lightning event, from the Mount Redoubt eruption in April 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors say this peak rate might even be an underestimate because instruments may have missed many bolts. Van Eaton said one lightning sensor network basically \u201cblew itself up\u201d because it was detecting so much lightning and became saturated.\n\nThe lightning also occurred even when other remote, infrared and seismic data were quiet, indicating that the eruption continued for hours longer than scientists had initially thought.\n\n\u201cThe Hunga Volcano eruption was a truly extreme event that created conditions that don\u2019t occur in traditional thunderstorms or other volcanic eruptions,\u201d said Vagasky, the manager of the Wisconsin Environmental Mesonet. \u201cIt was unlike any lightning event that I\u2019ve ever seen before, and it will be difficult to surpass.\u201d\n\nGeoscientist Sam Purkis, who was not involved in the research, said the study elegantly illuminates how volcanoes interact with the atmosphere. Scientists had already suspected that the eruption was a focal point for lightning, but the paper pinpoints how extreme it really was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a fascinating study and shows how the Tongan eruption influenced the Earth system in ways that you might not immediately associate with a volcanic explosion,\u201d Purkis, a professor at the University of Miami, wrote in an email.\n\nThese insights, the authors say, will help researchers better understand future volcanic eruptions as they are happening.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we want to be able to do this type of study in near real time to understand what\u2019s happening during an eruption that could be impacting aviation, could be impacting human infrastructure downwind, and basically to try to keep people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Van Eaton said.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/06/25/air-conditioner-energy-savings/": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nFor many people, beating the heat this summer means one thing: cranking up the air conditioner. Experts say having access to air conditioning isn\u2019t just about comfort. During extreme heat events, which are becoming more frequent and prolonged due to climate change, being in an air-conditioned space helps keep people safe.\n\nBut air conditioners can be expensive energy guzzlers. According to the Energy Department, air conditioning ranks as one of the biggest energy users in homes across much of the country \u2014 consuming about 6 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity, at an annual cost of about $29 billion to homeowners.\n\nThere are, however, changes you can make to your space and how you use your air conditioner that can save energy, said Jennifer Amann, senior fellow in the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group. Even adjusting your thermostat a couple of degrees warmer than what you normally keep it at could yield savings that add up over time, Amann said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA few percent here and there can really make a difference over the course of the summer,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat to know about your AC\n\nIn the United States, experts say people with air conditioning are likely using one of the following: conventional central air conditioning, window units, or various types of heat pumps, which include central systems that require ducts or ductless technology such as mini-split heat pumps.\n\nTogether with taking steps to keep your home cool, switching to a high-efficiency air conditioner could reduce your energy use by 20 to 50 percent, according to the Energy Department.\n\nIndustry groups such as the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provide efficiency ratings and can be helpful resources for consumers, said Wes Davis, technical services director of the Air Conditioning Contractors of America, a trade group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProper installation and maintenance of air conditioners can boost efficiency. Routinely replacing and cleaning filters, for instance, can lower an air-conditioning unit\u2019s energy consumption by 5 to 15 percent, the Energy Department says.\n\nBut Amann and other experts say how you run your air conditioner could also make a difference. Here are some energy-saving tips you can try:\n\nDon\u2019t run your AC 24 hours a day\n\nNot running your air conditioner when you don\u2019t need it can help cut down on energy use, but the savings often depend on a variety of factors, including how well your home is insulated, what type of system you\u2019re running and the weather outside, said Aisling Pigott, a graduate student studying building systems at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has researched whether shutting off cooling actually saves energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a published analysis that was not peer-reviewed, Pigott and other researchers found that less energy was used across the three types of air conditioners studied when cooling was shut off for an eight-hour period, compared to running the systems all day at 76 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhile the researchers noted that energy use temporarily spiked to recover from the higher indoor temperature that came from setting the thermostat to 89 degrees Fahrenheit, overall energy consumption was still less than having the air conditioners maintain cool conditions. In the case of a conventional central air conditioner, turning off cooling for eight hours a day could yield annual energy savings of up to 11 percent, the researchers wrote.\n\nBut Pigott said how much energy you could save isn\u2019t straightforward. If you\u2019re running your air conditioner at 72 degrees for 16 hours a day and then you turn it off for the eight hours you\u2019re not home, \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily save one-third of your energy cost by turning it off for one-third of the day,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the home is better insulated, the air conditioner is more efficient or the climate has less dramatic temperature swings, shutting the system off probably won\u2019t save as much energy.\n\nAnd while turning off your system is \u201cthe most efficient thing to do,\u201d it could result in indoor temperatures becoming uncomfortably warm, Amann said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have pets or you\u2019re not in a particularly humid climate, you may be able to turn the system off,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really just want to think about what the conditions get like in your home if you\u2019re not there and you have the system turned off.\u201d\n\nBut a ductless system, such as traditional window units or more advanced mini-split heat pumps, could allow for more flexibility, Amann said. These setups can offer more options for how they can be run than central systems, allowing you to focus on cooling or heating specific spaces instead of the entire home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to run every unit in your home,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s important, she and other experts said, to consult with your contractor or HVAC professional about how to best operate your system. For instance, Davis cautioned, more frequently starting and stopping your air conditioning unit could strain the system\u2019s motor.\n\nProgram your thermostat\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your home getting too warm, you can still get energy savings even though your system isn\u2019t completely off by adjusting your thermostat, Amann said.\n\nSmart thermostats, which can be programmed to suit your schedule, can help do this.\n\nWhen you\u2019re away from home, Amann said you can probably let the temperature go as much as five to seven degrees higher than what would normally be comfortable for you. A smart thermostat could be set to take into account when you typically come home, so that the indoor temperature is where you would like it to be when you return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCertainly when you\u2019re away from home, having those settings can make a big difference, particularly if you\u2019re if away all day for work or if you\u2019re away on vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou definitely want to make sure you\u2019re setting the thermostat up to allow the heat of the house to get a little warmer than normal.\u201d\n\nOther tips\n\nYou can help reduce the costs of running your air conditioner by taking other steps to keep your home cool.\n\nMake sure blinds or shades are closed during the hottest parts of the day, particularly if you don\u2019t have updated windows, Amann said.\n\nTry to avoid using appliances such as dishwashers, ovens and stovetops or dryers, which can make spaces hotter and more humid and force your air conditioner to work harder, she said.\n\nUsing ceiling fans could also allow you to keep your thermostat at a couple degrees warmer and still feel comfortable, Amann said.

Relentless rainfall inundated parts of the area \u2014 including 4.59 inches in a single hour at one spot in nearby Switzerland County, according to the National Weather Service. The deluge transformed the creek that runs near her home near Madison, Ind., into a raging river that swept away a calf and hundreds of hay bales, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe floodwaters tore the asphalt off the top of a nearby bridge, carried away numerous vehicles, ripped trees from their roots, left roads impassable.

And in the case of about 20 counties that are home to more than 1.3 million people \u2014 including parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and elsewhere \u2014 such extreme rain events could happen on average once a decade, if not more often, the group said.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the changes in expected rainfall intensity are startling for many areas in the United States,\u201d Jungho Kim, First Street\u2019s senior hydrologist and a lead author on the new study, said in announcing the findings. \u201cAnd it is important that Americans are fully aware of this consequence of climate change that can impact their lives and homes.\u201d\n\nThe warming atmosphere is supercharging various weather-related disasters \u2014 wildfires, hurricanes, crippling heat waves. But it also is fueling once-unthinkable amounts of rain in single bursts. The resulting deluges pose serious challenges in a nation where aging roads, antiquated storm-water systems and other infrastructure are increasingly outmatched.\n\nOver and over, scientists have documented a central explanation driving the shift toward more frequent devastating rains. For every degree Fahrenheit that the air temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold about 4 percent more water.\n\nThe world already has warmed at least 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 Celsius) since preindustrial times. That increased heat means more moisture in the air \u2014 in the United States, much of it comes off the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 and more fuel for more intense rainstorms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a growing acceptance that as the globe warms, extreme precipitation will increase,\u201d said Kenneth Kunkel, an atmospheric sciences professor at North Carolina State University who has studied precipitation trends for decades.\n\nAs that happens, having accurate data about changing precipitation patterns is critical for communities nationwide.\n\nIn recent years, most notably in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress set aside hundreds of billions of dollars to fund historic upgrades to the nation\u2019s drinking water systems, bridges, rail systems, interstates, ports and other key infrastructure.\n\nBut Eby and others worry that there is a risk that large sums of money could be wasted on projects that are not actually designed to stand the test of time, given that the climate of the future will look very different from the past.\n\nChad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said that for a long time, the government\u2019s approach toward precipitation estimates assumed that the probabilities of extreme events remained relatively constant in a given place.\n\n\u201cFor decades, that probably worked fairly well,\u201d Berginnis said of relying on historical data alone. But, he added, \u201cover the last couple decades, that has changed pretty significantly.\u201d\n\nIn Harris County, Tex., home to Houston, First Street estimates that 60 percent more rain could now fall during a 1-in-100-year storm compared with what Atlas 14 shows for the area. The same goes for the areas around Baltimore and Philadelphia.\n\nAs climate change fuels more extreme rain events, particularly in places such as the Northeast, the Ohio River Valley and along parts of the Gulf Coast, the old assumptions are no longer sufficient. While some jurisdictions might be able to pay to undertake more elaborate studies of potential risks in a hotter future, many local officials and planners must rely primarily on NOAA\u2019s existing precipitation frequency estimates when deciding how to build a new project.\n\n\u201cEvery year we are spending millions and billions of dollars on infrastructure, and we are doing it only looking to the past for guidance, and not looking into the future,\u201d Kunkel said.\n\nNOAA is keenly aware of the issue, but until recently did not have the resources to construct forward-looking, nationwide estimates of precipitation that also account for the impacts of climate change. Last year, however, Congress gave the agency new funding to create a more robust, comprehensive set of data for every corner of the country \u2014 and to update its estimate no less frequently than once every 10 years.\n\nThe agency is working steadily toward that goal. But it has said the work will take years and probably won\u2019t be complete until 2027.\n\nIn a statement, NOAA declined to comment on First Street\u2019s research. But the agency said the \u201cscientific rigor\u201d behind its precipitation frequency estimates is why they are the standard relied on by engineers and city and regional planners across the country.\n\nThe agency\u2019s methodology \u201cundergoes a rigorous peer review process and employs broad stakeholder engagement\u201d to ensure accuracy, transparency and trust, it said.\n\nNOAA is working to develop Atlas 15, which will incorporate historical changes in rainfall intensity as well as estimates based on models of future climate conditions. The agency said it also \u201cis concurrently undertaking experimental research and testing of methodologies to use its extensive climate modeling capabilities to provide accurate estimates of future precipitation on a global scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs engineers, public works officials and planners wait for updated, authoritative federal projections, First Street is hoping to help fill the gap by offering what it calls \u201can early understanding\u201d of what NOAA\u2019s estimates are likely to produce.\n\n\u201cThe First Street data might have the greatest value in the immediate planning environment,\u201d said David Conrad, senior water resource policy adviser to the flood plain managers group. \u201cPeople can look at that and say, \u2018Are we on track? And should we make any adjustments?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answers matter. In the case of a city expanding a storm-water system, underestimating how often heavy downpours might occur could mean pipes won\u2019t drain fast enough to prevent flooding on streets or in homes. A new road could flood more often than expected, shortening its useful life.\n\nFirst Street, which has previously examined how climate change is deepening risks posed by floods, wildfires, heat and hurricane wind strength, created its latest analysis using data from nearly 800 federal weather stations. Researchers focused on the past 20 years of rain gauge data, in an effort to highlight how the warming atmosphere has increasingly played a role in more intense rain events.\n\nAs with the group\u2019s previous analysis, the latest findings underscore how significant amounts of risk are likely unaccounted for in parts of the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmericans should consider the rising number of catastrophic rain events in recent decades not as outliers, but rather \u201cas the \u2018new normal\u2019 for many areas,\u201d Monday\u2019s report finds. \u201cWhat this means for communities today is that their understanding of risk is often underestimated,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cand in many locations the infrastructure in place or that is currently being built to protect communities, property and individuals is built to an insufficient standard.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Eby said he hopes the findings will help officials think carefully about how they spend taxpayer dollars on major projects, and to have the foresight to grasp how the atmosphere in many places is changing.\n\n\u201cThis data hopefully will open people\u2019s eyes,\u201d he said. \u201c[To] realize what the true risk is today, and also what it will be in the future.\u201d", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/06/22/biden-carbon-capture-climate-environmentalists/": "Climate Why these environmentalists are resisting part of Biden\u2019s climate push Louisiana wants oversight of industry carbon storage, and EPA is prepared to grant it.

ArrowRight But the Biden administration faces big resistance from a key ally: environmentalists.\n\nMany, led by environmental justice advocates, object to carbon capture projects, especially in a region where petrochemical plants often sit next to Black churches and schools, and high cancer rates have led to the nickname \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d Some fear carbon capture will perpetuate fossil fuel industries they want to phase out. Others fear the direct local impacts of pipelines and other planned infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe administration, backed by numerous climate scientists and lawmakers, sees carbon capture as a key tool to reduce emissions from businesses that have few other options. But that position pits major Biden administration priorities against one another. Many environmental justice advocates view it as a test case for President Biden\u2019s commitment to their cause.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do to Louisiana now is I think the worst of anything we\u2019ve been exposed to, because of all the uncertainty,\u201d said Beverly Wright, the executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in east New Orleans and a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.\n\n\u201cIn the real world, this is an experiment,\u201d Wright added. \u201cAnd this experiment is going to be conducted on the same communities that have suffered from the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nPartly because of a financial push by Congress, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency are backing a state plan to speed up storage projects, which aim to stuff heat-trapping gases underground instead of releasing them into the atmosphere. Louisiana has become the biggest hot spot \u2014 with $80 billion in pending projects \u2014 and the EPA is proposing to hand over regulation to state officials who say they can do the job faster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo hear from Bayou State residents on carbon capture, the EPA held meetings last week from Wednesday through Friday in Baton Rouge, extending the hearings by a day to meet the demand.\n\nDonaldsonville, some 65 miles west of New Orleans, is a majority-Black town of nearly 7,000, the seat of Ascension Parish in the center of the state\u2019s Mississippi River industrial corridor. The world\u2019s largest ammonia and nitrogen plant \u2014 also the state\u2019s largest industrial greenhouse-gas emitter \u2014 sprawls across the pancake-flat flood plain just two miles downriver. Major pipelines carry gas and hazardous liquids just south of town, and are slated to soon carry captured carbon dioxide out of the area. Two companies have plans to keep the carbon here, at more than 4,000 feet underground surrounding the town.\n\nThe poverty rate in Donaldsonville approaches 50 percent, according to U.S. census data, and local officials often mention a recent survey ranking it as the country\u2019s second-worst city to live in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike some in the area, Chad Ross, 37, said he had not previously heard of carbon-capture projects, or proposals for it nearby, but that he would be against it because of the local legacy of pollution.\n\n\u201cIt is called Cancer Alley, and that\u2019s part of the reason we don\u2019t trust them,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not so good to have all these plants, so many of them, all around us. Anything could happen.\u201d\n\nMistrust is also why Ashley Gaignard, 46, a part-time secretary for the city\u2019s council, questions government assurances. She doesn\u2019t buy into claims that carbon capture will safely cut their greenhouse-gas emissions, and she is frustrated that the administration has backed an industry-friendly solution she said amounts to an experiment on her community.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it in my neighborhood. Do it where you live,\u201d said Gaignard, who voted for Biden in 2020 and is the founder of a group working to preserve rural land. \u201cRight about now it\u2019s politics over people. And I don\u2019t think they give a damn about people.\u201d\n\nMany government-backed climate solutions are facing resistance nationwide. That includes wind and solar farms, electric transmission, and the mining projects to support production of batteries and other clean energy technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Louisiana, one of the most controversial proposals comes from the industrial gas supply company Air Products. It wants to build a carbon-capture network through several parishes as part of a $4.5 billion project to produce hydrogen at a new plant in Ascension Parish. If it works, the system would significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the plant\u2019s hydrogen, producing a low-emissions fuel that several industries and countries say they need to cut their contribution to climate change.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to reach these clean-energy goals without transitioning to a clean-energy source,\u201d said Danna LeBlanc, the commercial executive director overseeing the project at Air Products. \u201cWe\u2019re building a hydrogen plant because it is the future of the energy transition.\u201d\n\nA mix of companies have proposed other projects. The oil giant ExxonMobil is part of a $200 million project to add a carbon-capture system to Donaldsonville\u2019s huge ammonia plant, owned by CF Industries. An arm of the private equity giant Blackstone says it has acquired rights to 30,000 surface acres for underground storage around the town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe surge of investment is in part a response to new government incentives. The bipartisan infrastructure spending package of 2021 included nearly $18 billion combined for carbon capture and hydrogen.\n\nAnd last year\u2019s climate-spending package passed by Democrats, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, expanded tax credits for every ton of carbon a company captures, now as much as $85 a ton, up from $50.\n\nWhile federal money is now flowing, the EPA has been slow to process permits that companies are seeking to inject the carbon into underground containment. It has approved just two, with a backlog of 75 still in review.\n\nState officials and lobbyists say Louisiana \u2014 once it gets federal approval \u2014 can hire staff dedicated to local projects to help speed up permitting. Two years ago, the state formally sought permission to oversee regulation. The EPA is now proposing to grant it, after months of review of the state\u2019s program and a request for more attention to racial justice in permitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPublic input and debate is not an obstacle \u2014 it is a feature and it is what leads to good policy,\u201d EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said in an email. The agency\u2019s regional leaders have \u201cworked extensively with the state of Louisiana to ensure its primacy application reflected essential environmental justice and equity considerations.\u201d\n\nBut many local critics say Louisiana doesn\u2019t deserve such power because of its history of weak oversight. Legislative audits in the last decade have found the state behind on forcing oil and gas companies to plug disused wells and on inspecting out-of-compliance wells \u2014 although the most recent audit noted great improvements since 2014.\n\nState officials say that they are hiring seven full-time engineers and geologists and that they will be able to mandate extensive studies and controls to ensure safe operations. Louisiana\u2019s new rule package would require continuous monitoring from companies to prevent leaks. State officials say they are adopting all EPA rules, plus more extensive requirements \u2014 including that companies review every existing wellbore in their carbon storage area and model the resulting pressure as carbon fills the void.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a rigorous process that we take a lot of time and effort to make sure that it is being done the right way,\u201d said Jason Lanclos, director of the State Energy Office in Louisiana\u2019s Natural Resources Department.\n\nDemocrats hold the governor\u2019s office in Louisiana, and Gov. John Bel Edwards published a climate action plan that recommended deploying carbon capture. His task force framed climate action as a way for the state to stay competitive in energy, manufacturing and maritime shipping, similar to President Biden\u2019s merging of climate and economic policy.\n\nIn Donaldsonville, the mayor and parish leaders see the wave of proposals as a potentially once-in-a-generation chance to revitalize the town. They are touting pledges for millions of dollars in donations from developers \u2014 if their projects move forward \u2014 to fund childhood development and workforce training.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor Leroy Sullivan, who is Black, said environmental and racial justice advocates would also complain if the state blocked carbon capture and Texas was successful in luring industry and its jobs there. Sullivan himself was heavily burned in an explosion at the CF Industries plant where he was working 23 years ago. But he said the community doesn\u2019t have a choice but to trust local oil and chemical companies if they are to make progress.\n\n\u201cWe have to move on from that and figure out how we can solve problems in the future,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to them as well. A lot of good things have come from the industry as well.\u201d\n\nThat puts him at odds with national leaders of the environmental justice movement. Earlier this month, leaders from a dozen different groups nationwide joined the Deep South Center in a statement decrying carbon-capture development.\n\nThe group, including several members of the White House advisory committee, said government help for carbon capture and storage, also known by the initials CCS, undermines the transition away from fossil fuels. And \u201cno regulatory regime at any level of government\u201d can protect environmental justice communities from dangers associated with CCS, the statement said.\n\n\u201cI think what bothers me the most is that the oil industry is behind pushing CCS,\u201d Wright said in an interview. \u201cThey can continue doing what they do to make money without doing anything to actually reduce their carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nIndustry officials dispute that, and say the technology will work.\n\n\u201cCCS is a proven technology explicitly endorsed by the Biden Administration, the European Union and the United Nations, all frequent critics of oil and gas,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nIn Louisiana, Black activists have found an uncommon ally in more conservative, White suburban and rural communities around Lake Maurepas. Air Products has struck a deal to put its waste carbon a mile deep under the lake, but locals have resisted, fearing what it would mean for shrimping and the lake\u2019s health if the underground storage leaks.\n\nLivingston Parish passed a moratorium on drilling wells to connect the storage but withdrew it after Air Products won a court victory against it.\n\nDespite the state\u2019s support for CCS development, there hasn\u2019t yet been enough analysis of the full risk, said Alex Kolker, a coastal geologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium who has studied underground storage and served on the science advisory panel of the governor\u2019s climate task force. The top threats are the many old oil and gas wells statewide that could cause the new storage sites to leak, he said. Pumping carbon into underground layers could also lead to earthquakes, and the pipelines needed to transport waste carbon have a track record of explosions and contributing to coastal land loss, he added.\n\n\u201cThere are many cases in which (carbon capture) well may work,\u201d he said, adding though that, \u201cwhat\u2019s being proposed is much larger than what\u2019s been done in the past.\u201d\n\nEric Larson, part of a Princeton University team that has researched emissions reduction and carbon-capture siting, said regulators will need to devote time to ensure these projects don\u2019t result in disasters, even in the face of competing pressures.\n\nEvery scenario Larson\u2019s team found for meeting President Biden\u2019s climate pledge \u2014 to halve U.S. emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels \u2014 included carbon capture. Alternatives to fossil fuels often aren\u2019t as effective for heavy industry operations, and its opponents don\u2019t \u201chave enough leverage\u201d to force them to move, he said.\n\n\u201cI would rather have some other solution than CO2 storage, but I don\u2019t see that we have a lot of choice. It\u2019s like anything, there are going to be trade-offs,\u201d Larson said.\n\nThat has frustrated environmental justice advocates. They fear a repeat of the surge of multibillion-dollar petrochemical and gas-export plants in Louisiana fed by the country\u2019s shale gas boom \u2014 often too quickly for activists to recruit community members to fight and stop it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to stop it in the permitting stage,\u201d said Travis London, 41, of Donaldsonville, who works for Gulf South for a Green New Deal, a coalition of regional groups. \u201cAs long as they have their permits, they\u2019re going to do whatever they want to do.\u201d\n\nLast week, London and another grass-roots organizer for Earthworks advertised a community meeting in a Black neighborhood directly across the river from Donaldsonville, in a town called Darrow.\n\nThey advertised a free dinner, face painting and artwork for children. Five people attended, according to an organizer and two others working at the event. A second organizer said roughly a dozen adults ultimately showed up, with some arriving late.\n\ncorrection A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to hydrogen fuel made with a carbon-capture system as zero-carbon.

In a filing Tuesday, the EPA said it had taken steps to protect vulnerable communities \u2014 including striking agreements with plants to better handle their waste and new proposed rules to limit air pollution \u2014 and thus was dropping the probe.\n\nIn their filings, the EPA and lawyers at the Justice Department said they will not take civil rights enforcement action against the agencies, Louisiana\u2019s Department of Health and Department of Environmental Quality. Local environmental activists were disappointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like we were put on the back burner,\u201d said Sharon Lavigne, founder of the local activist group Rise St. James.\n\nThe decision is a potential legal setback to the Biden administration\u2019s promise to help poor and minority communities disproportionately subjected to pollution, especially Black neighborhoods in Louisiana. The EPA had been investigating the state in part for its oversight of chemical companies in an industrial corridor along the Mississippi River long plagued by high cancer risks.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry (R), also a gubernatorial candidate, has fought the effort with a federal lawsuit claiming the EPA overstepped its authority. The attorney general has asked federal judges in the Western District of Louisiana to block the investigation of Louisiana, saying the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not, as the EPA claims, give it the power to take action against policies that discriminate by creating a \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d such as heavier pollution in Black neighborhoods compared with others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe type of legal authority has been rarely invoked but became a key part of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy as it sought to undertake a first-ever effort to address how much more likely minority communities are to be subjected to toxic waste and industrial pollution. In addition to the Louisiana investigation, the effort included civil rights cases against Houston over illegal dumping in Black and Latino neighborhoods and against an Alabama state agency and a county there for neglect and inaction over risks to Black residents from raw sewage.\n\nFederal enforcement under this part of the Civil Rights Act \u201cis a critical component for addressing environmental injustice,\u201d said Patrice Simms, vice president for healthy communities at Earthjustice, which represented two environmental groups in a complaint that led to the EPA\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt would be deeply troubling for the EPA to back away from its commitment.\u201d\n\nOfficials at Louisiana\u2019s environmental quality and health departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

That may have played a role in the EPA\u2019s decision, but it also raises the risk of emboldening Republican-led states to resist Biden administration efforts to enforce civil rights law, Simms said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EPA investigation examined whether the state\u2019s health department failed to provide proper assistance to Black residents on how to reduce exposure to pollution from a neoprene facility operated by Denka, a Japanese chemicals firm. And the federal agency was reviewing the state Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s permitting of facilities in St. John the Baptist and St. James parishes, and elsewhere, including a controversial $9.4 billion complex proposed by the Formosa Plastics Group.\n\nIn St. James Parish, where Rise St. James seeks to block the Formosa plant, Sharon Lavigne described the federal government\u2019s action as hurtful but said she firmly believes in EPA Administrator Michael Regan.\n\nRegan is the only EPA administrator to have personally traveled to her home and assured her that the agency cares about her community\u2019s health, she said. \u201cThat shows me that he cares and he\u2019s working on things for us, and I know he\u2019s not lying.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDown a highway along the Mississippi River where chemical plants stretch for miles, Robert Taylor of St. John the Baptist Parish had a different perspective. \u201cI would never support the government abandoning their obligation,\u201d said Taylor, founder and executive director of the Concerned Citizens of St. John.\n\n\u201cIt will not help the residents here. They know that we are the targets of these industries,\u201d Taylor said, adding that chemical companies and their political supporters \u201cbrag that we are the low-hanging fruit. We have the least protection. And now the federal government can\u2019t provide protection.\u201d\n\nThe area known as Cancer Alley winds for 85 miles along the Mississippi between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Black schools and churches frequently sit near petrochemical plants and industrial sites, which are often built on former plantation land and situated to take advantage of access to oil, gas and major ports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Denka Performance Elastomer plant, near Fifth Ward Elementary School, emits a hazardous pollutant called chloroprene, which the EPA identifies as \u201ca likely human carcinogen.\u201d The census tract containing the school has an overall cancer rate that is 25 percent higher than the state average, according to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nIn preliminary findings of its civil rights investigation that the EPA issued last year, it found children at the school and residents nearby were exposed to chloroprene air concentrations at levels high enough to raise their lifetime risk of cancer. But the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality did not respond to most of the provisions in an agreement to address the EPA\u2019s findings under negotiation between the agencies, and they were not on pace to finalize a deal by a legal deadline coming in July, the EPA said in a letter filed with the court Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSeparate and apart\u201d from its civil rights law authorities, the EPA \u201chas taken a series of significant actions directed at or otherwise resulting in reducing the impacts of chloroprene emissions from the Denka facility,\u201d the federal agency wrote in the letter addressed to the Louisiana regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year in a separate action, the Justice Department sued Denka to try to compel it to curb emissions of chloroprene. That case is ongoing and expected to continue. A spokesman for Denka said company officials were not yet able to comment on the investigation or the EPA\u2019s decision.\n\nBoth Rise St. James and the Concerned Citizens of St. John are scheduled to hold a meeting Tuesday night to consider the way forward. Lavigne said she will place her faith in Regan and continue the fight. Taylor said his group is not done opposing the Denka chemical plant next door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start our planning all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up \u2026 The conditions under which the people of Cancer Alley live is not fit for habitation.\u201d\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/28/introducing-posts-expanded-climate-coverage/": "More on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate: Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather disasters are undeniably linked to it.

Magnetic fields unleashed by a solar superstorm rip through Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, sending currents surging through human infrastructure. Aurora borealis unusually fill southern skies with shimmering blues and greens. We look up from our phones and computers to catch a glimpse, and the internet as we know it blinks out.\n\nPhysically, most of us are fine. But in a matter of hours, we are boomeranged back to the analog era, where the only thing that tweets is the bird outside our window.\n\nThe \u201cinternet apocalypse,\u201d as it\u2019s called, has recently captured imaginations on social media, prompting quick-spreading misinformation about nonexistent NASA warnings and speculation about what the hyper-online might do with themselves in an offline world. Apocalypse preppers, religious doomsday Redditors and writers have all, at some point, seized on the idea.\n\nAnd it\u2019s easy to understand the intrigue. Virtually every aspect of human life is bound up in the internet, and its absence could have disastrous consequences \u2014 not to mention that many of us can barely stand a 30-second elevator ride without WiFi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut drama aside, these concerns are not entirely fiction. A widespread internet outage could, indeed, be brought on by a strong solar storm hitting Earth \u2014 a rare but very real event that has not yet happened in the digital age, experts say. When a solar storm known as the Carrington Event struck in 1859, telegraph lines sparked, operators were electrocuted and the northern lights descended to latitudes as low as Jamaica. A 1989 solar storm took out the Quebec power grid for hours. And in 2012, a storm just missed Earth.\n\nAs the sun, which has roughly 11-year cycles, enters a particularly active period known as the \u201csolar maximum\u201d in 2025, some are worried our interconnected world is not prepared.\n\nSangeetha Abdu Jyothi, a computer science professor at University of California at Irvine whose paper \u201cSolar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse\u201d has played a role in popularizing the term, started thinking about internet resilience when the coronavirus began to spread, and she realized how unprepared we were for a pandemic. Research on widespread internet failure was scant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never experienced one of the extreme case events, and we don\u2019t know how our infrastructure would respond to it,\u201d Jyothi said. \u201cOur failure testing doesn\u2019t even include such scenarios.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe notes that a severe solar storm is likely to affect large-scale infrastructure such as submarine communication cables, which could interrupt long-distance connectivity. If you have not lost power, you might have access to, say, a government website hosted locally, but reaching bigger websites, which could have data stored all over the place, might not be possible.\n\nThe northern latitudes are also especially vulnerable to solar storms, and that\u2019s where a lot of internet infrastructure is concentrated. \u201cThis is not taken into account in our infrastructure deployment today at all,\u201d she said.\n\nSuch outages could last for months, depending on the scale and how long it takes to repair the damage. The economic impact of just one day of lost connectivity in the United States alone is estimated to be more than $11 billion, according to the internet watcher NetBlocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Jyothi says she has felt bad for using the term \u201cinternet apocalypse\u201d in her paper. There\u2019s not much ordinary people can do to prepare for such a phenomenon; it falls on governments and companies. And the paper \u201cjust got too much attention,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cResearchers have been talking for a long time about how this could affect the power grid,\u201d she notes, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t scare people to the same extent for some reason.\u201d Losing power also causes one to lose internet, of course.\n\nThe recent online panic appears to have been sparked by recent discoveries from the Parker Solar Probe, a NASA device launched in 2018 to research the physics of the sun and the solar atmosphere \u2014 not to keep the WiFi from going out, as TikTok would have you think.\n\nA few weeks ago, scientists published new evidence from the probe about the source of solar winds, which they say are the result of a phenomenon called \u201cmagnetic reconnection.\u201d While the research did not look specifically at solar storms, it has broader relevance. The solar atmosphere changes very slowly, says Stuart D. Bale, a physics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a principal investigator for NASA working on the probe. So \u201canytime something changes really fast magnetically on the sun, it\u2019s probably due to reconnection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoronal mass ejections, expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields that can power damaging solar storms, occur over a short time frame and are probably a part of this mechanism, he said.\n\n\u201cThe more we know about magnetic reconnection on the sun,\u201d Bale said \u201cthe more predictive power it\u2019s going to give us for space weather.\u201d\n\nSpeaking while on a trip to Japan, Bale said he understands the sort of panic the \u201cinternet apocalypse\u201d idea instills. \u201cMy wife has gone up to some town three hours from here. And the only way she knows her way back is with her phone, and we don\u2019t have any cash,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could really be a mess.\u201d\n\nBut typically, Bale doesn\u2019t worry about solar storms too much. \u201cIn some ways, I\u2019d rather be growing my own potatoes in the countryside, not using a mobile phone,\u201d he said.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/": "Funding from the infrastructure law comes as floods and heat waves batter the nation and gives Biden another chance to use climate carrots instead of sticks.", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/?itid=hp_top_nav_climate": "Funding from the infrastructure law comes as floods and heat waves batter the nation and gives Biden another chance to use climate carrots instead of sticks.", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/": "The scientific community was a little conservative in planning their agenda for the first year of observations, but this next year of science will take full advantage of what the telescope can do, the telescope\u2019s senior project scientist said.", "https://www.google.com/search?q=washington+post&rlz=1C1CHBF_deDE984DE984&oq=washington+post&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433i512j0i3j0i512l5j5.5980j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8": "Google-Dienste anzubieten und zu betreiben\n\nAusf\u00e4lle zu pr\u00fcfen und Ma\u00dfnahmen gegen Spam, Betrug und Missbrauch zu ergreifen\n\nDaten zu Zielgruppeninteraktionen und Websitestatistiken zu erheben.
