    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-brain-health_l_6426e714e4b00c951751c2f2": "When we think about improving our brain health, we often think about mind-stimulating activities like crossword puzzles, Sudoku or Wordle. But there\u2019s a lot more to a sharp mind than brain games: Day-to-day habits play a big role in brain health, too, starting with your diet.\nWhile occasionally indulging in certain foods that aren\u2019t great for your brain is fine, there are popular (and admittedly delicious) foods and beverages that people who specialize in brain health \u2014 like neurologists and neuroscientists \u2014 do their very best to avoid. Here are seven of them.\nProtein powder\nIn the habit of adding a scoop of protein powder to your daily smoothie? You may want to stop, or at the very least, check the ingredients. While protein powder is often marketed as a healthy, lower-calorie option for people trying to lose or maintain weight, a lot of them are filled with artificial sweeteners, according to neuroscientist Friederike Fabritius.\n\u201cIt is those additives that really give me pause when it comes to protein powders because they wreak havoc on your gastrointestinal microbiome,\u201d Fabritius said. \u201cA healthy and robust internal microbiome is so important for great brain health because most of our neurotransmitters are produced in the gut.\u201d\nSoda\nSorry, soda drinkers. Neurologist Dr. Shaheen Lakhan says your favorite bubbly beverage is just flat-out bad for your brain. \u201cSoda is one of the worst foods for brain health due to the high concentration of simple sugars, which damage the blood vessels supplying the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, this starves the brain from the very fuels it needs to function, leading to premature dementia and strokes. Acutely, sugar also causes brain inflammation, irritability, poor mood and sleep disturbances.\u201d\nPlus, the constant highs and lows (the proverbial sugar \u201crush\u201d and \u201ccrash\u201d) can also cause a state of addiction with cravings and withdrawals \u2014 and diet soda is no better. \u201cEven diet or zero versions of soda have negative effects, as the calorie-free additives stress out the brain and trick it into consuming more calories and craving real sugar,\u201d he said.\nMargarine\nDown with fake butter! Dr. Shae Datta, a neurologist and co-director of the NYU Langone Concussion Center, said she avoids margarine as much as possible because it contains trans fats. (Though it should be noted that there are butter alternatives without trans fats, so take a close look at the ingredients list.)\n\u201cWe often hear that trans fats aren\u2019t good for your heart and blood vessels. The same applies to the vessels of the brain,\u201d she said. \u201cA study from the journal Neurology found that older adults who had the highest levels of elaidic acid (a common type of trans fat) in their blood were more likely to develop dementia. Better to stick to olive oil and real butter.\u201d\nCannabis-infused foods\nWith the rise of CBD and the legalization of marijuana in most states, this one might come as a bit of a surprise. But just because cannabis is legal and can help you relax doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doing great things for your brain.\n\u201cBesides the short-term cognitive impairing effects of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as THC, or what produces the \u2018high\u2019) appears to constrict arteries in the brain,\u201d said Dr. Lester Leung, a neurologist and the director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Tufts Medical Center. \u201cThis can be very dangerous when used in large amounts by people with migraines, a very common headache condition that, together with heavy cannabis use, can lead to stroke, even in young, otherwise healthy people.\u201d\nBeer\nThis summer, you may want to skip the beer at your neighborhood barbecue. \u201cBeer is comprised completely of empty calories with no nutritional value,\u201d said Dr. Byran Ho, a neurologist and director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center. \u201cAlcohol is a neurotoxin that can injure both the central and peripheral nervous system, even if consumed in moderate amounts.\u201d\nDecaf coffee\nIf you\u2019re a fan of decaf, Sean Callan, a neuroscientist and CEO of Ellipse Analytics, recommends you skip this jolt-free beverage unless you\u2019re sure the decaffeination process is solvent-free.\n\u201cSolvents, the chemicals used to remove caffeine from coffee, are generally toxic to humans,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are linked to increased risk of cancer or neurological harm, especially in large or repeated doses. Beyond that, solvents like methylene chloride (a solvent commonly used in the decaffeination process) are known to cross the placenta, meaning pregnant women risk exposing their unborn child to the solvent.\u201d\nIf you still want to enjoy decaf coffee, Callan recommends you visit the site checkyourdecaf.org, where you can find out what chemicals are in any decaf brands you drink.\nFrench fries\nHere\u2019s another bummer: French fries are one of the main foods neurologist Dr. Pedram Navab avoids. \u201cA diet that incorporates fatty foods like French fries can damage blood vessels that supply the brain, causing cognitive impairment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reduces the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and leads to neuronal damage of the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is instrumental for learning and memory.\u201d\nWhile some of these foods may be easier to cut out \u2014 looking at you, protein powder and decaf coffee \u2014 some might be a bit harder. So remember to consume any favorite foods and beverages that may damage brain health in moderation, and when possible, opt for a healthier version of it.",

But you\u2019re probably not thinking too much about the beverages you\u2019re consuming and how they contribute to (or take away from) your health goals.\n\u201cUnfortunately, in this country, so much of the added sugar we\u2019re consuming is coming from sugar-sweetened beverages,\u201d said Heather Nace, a registered dietitian and the director of operations at Tulane University\u2019s Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine in New Orleans.\nNace said that too much added sugar is detrimental to our health for a number of reasons: There\u2019s a connection between added sugar and diabetes, a link between added sugar and cardiovascular disease and it can be tied to cognitive problems.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not good for us, [but] it can also be tricky to avoid,\u201d Nace said.\nBut experts don\u2019t say you should completely cut sugar-sweetened beverages from your diet. You can still have a soda here and there.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a time and place for everything to fit into a healthy diet,\u201d Nace said, \u201cbut if you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s drinking soda as your main beverage throughout the day, it\u2019s something to be mindful of.\u201d\nWhy? There are a few reasons. Below, experts share the beverages they tend to avoid and the reasoning behind their choices.\nDiet Soda\n\u201cFor me, personally, I don\u2019t like diet beverages and diet sodas,\u201d said Carlie Saint-Laurent Beaucejour, a registered dietitian and owner of Crave With Carlie, a virtual nutrition practice.\nDepending on the artificial sweetener in these drinks, she said she doesn\u2019t enjoy the aftertaste.\nAnd it\u2019s \u201calso the side effects \u2026 just because it can cause bloating and other digestive issues that may not be good \u2014 I do see that a lot in people that I work with,\u201d she said.\nArtificial sweeteners can affect your digestion, research shows. Additionally, artificial sweeteners affect your sweet tolerance and make you want sweeter things, Saint-Laurent Beaucejour said.\nBut, again, she also believes that all foods and drinks can fit into a meal plan \u2014 so, for most folks, if you\u2019re going to have soda, go for a half can instead of a full can of diet soda.\nSaint-Laurent Beaucejour added that dietary advice is individualized, though, so for someone with diabetes, diet soda is the best option because it won\u2019t have as much of an effect on blood sugar.\nRegular Soda\nIn addition to diet soda, regular soda is not a frequent beverage choice among the experts who spoke to HuffPost.\n\u201cSoda would be the one for me,\u201d said Nace, who noted that the added sugar is a major reason why.\n\u201cA 12-ounce can of soda has about 39 grams of sugar in it,\u201d she said, and the current dietary guidelines say 10% of our total daily calories should come from added sugars \u2014 so, for a 2,000-calorie diet, one can of soda is almost equivalent to that 10% limit. And it\u2019s pretty common to have more than just one 12-ounce can of soda in a day.\nJeanette Andrade, a clinical dietitian in the food science and human nutrition department at the University of Florida, added that soda \u201cdoesn\u2019t contribute to any kind of health benefits for me ... it doesn\u2019t really have a lot of vitamins or minerals in there.\u201d\nEnergy Drinks\n\u201cThe thing about energy drinks, which is really interesting, is most people ... think of them as being, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s going to give me energy,\u2019\u201d Nace said. \u201cThey sort of often overlook the fact they also have a lot of this added sugar.\u201d\nShe said that one 8-ounce can of Red Bull has 27 grams of sugar, which is equal to about 7 teaspoons of sugar.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, women should limit themselves to 6 teaspoons of sugar per day. For men, it\u2019s 9 teaspoons. One can of Red Bull is more sugar than a woman should have a day and is nearly the daily allotment for men.\nJuices\nJuices also fall in line with the high sugar concerns that experts have. For example, Minute Maid\u2019s fruit punch drink has 24 grams of sugar in an 8-ounce glass, which is comparable to the high amount of sugar in Red Bull.\nJennifer Scherer, a fitness nutrition professional and president of Fredericksburg Fitness Studio in Virginia, said this is why she avoids drinks like apple juice, Hawaiian Punch and sugar-sweetened lemonade.\n\u201cI\u2019m just of the belief that you should have the whole fruit itself, which has the fiber,\u201d Scherer said.\nWhen she has a craving for something sweet, she reaches for an orange instead of orange juice.\nAlcohol ... With A Caveat\nAt first thought, alcohol seems like something to avoid \u2014 it\u2019s often high in sugar, is linked with liver damage and increases your risk of cancer.\nAdditionally, some people have adverse reactions to alcohol and can\u2019t tolerate it at all, Andrade said.\nBut research says that certain alcohols \u2014 namely, red wine \u2014 potentially carry a small health benefit, she added.\n\u201cDark red wines \u2015 not necessarily a ros\u00e9, that\u2019s not going to give you as much antioxidant boost \u2015 but the really dark, rich red wines,\u201d she said.\nThe exact benefits of red wine still need to be explored, Dr. Don Pham, a cardiologist in Houston, previously told HuffPost. There\u2019s some thought that resveratrol, an antioxidant in red wine, can lower inflammation and blood clot risk, Pham said, but more research is needed because the data has been mixed.\nBeyond wine, though, Andrade said the mixers that accompany cocktails add to the beverage\u2019s caloric and sugar contents (like margarita mix in tequila or rum in a rum and Coke). For example, 4 ounces of Margaritaville margarita mix has 26 grams of sugar, which is just as much as a can of Red Bull.\nOn top of that, folks often don\u2019t accurately disclose how much alcohol they truly drink, Andrade said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a taboo subject that no one really wants to admit. And if they do admit to it, they\u2019re usually underestimating how much they\u2019re consuming,\u201d Andrade said.\nWhen you underestimate how much alcohol you consume, you\u2019re also underestimating the amount of sugar that you\u2019re drinking alongside your dinner.\nAnd, as the experts pointed out, high-sugar beverages can be OK sometimes, but drinking them shouldn\u2019t become a habit.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cancer-doctors-food_l_64357018e4b0c2da1508a4a9": "When you think of lowering your cancer risk, your mind probably goes to quitting smoking, exercising regularly and wearing a sun hat and sunscreen.\nBut so much of your cancer risk is dependent on other behaviors, too, like how much alcohol you drink and the kinds of food you eat.\nUnfortunately, carcinogens are everywhere and hard to avoid.\n\u201cMy philosophy is you need to manage your exposure to cancer-causing agents or carcinogens. You cannot remove carcinogens from your entire life,\u201d said Dr. Otis Brawley, the associate director of community outreach and engagement at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nPart of managing your exposure is understanding what foods contribute to your cancer risk so you can limit your consumption.\nAdditionally, Dr. Xavier Llor, the medical director of the colorectal cancer prevention program at Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven Health, said many of the items he avoids for cancer risk reasons he also avoids for other health reasons, too.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s kind of like most of this stuff is just not good for a variety of reasons,\u201d Llor said. Very few things are bad for one aspect of your health but great for another \u2014 for example, many foods carry both a cancer risk and cardiovascular risk, he noted.\nBelow, cancer doctors share the foods they avoid to help lessen their cancer risk.\nHot Dogs, Sausage, Bacon, Deli Meat And Other Processed Meats\nYou probably know that processed meats are not a healthy food choice. In fact, Dr. Diane Reidy-Lagunes, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said processed meats are linked to cancer (in addition to conditions like heart disease and diabetes).\n\u201cProcessed meats include food such as hot dogs, sausage, bacon and others such as deli meats,\u201d Reidy-Lagunes told HuffPost via email. \u201cIt is believed that the preservatives, (such [as] nitrates or nitrites) can lead to the formation of potentially cancer-causing chemicals.\u201d\nAccording to Reidy-Lagunes, processed meats are classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization, which is in the same category as tobacco, smoking and asbestos.\n\u201cHowever, it is important to note that this doesn\u2019t mean that the risk of eating processed meat and developing cancer is the same risk as smoking and the development of cancer; the level of risk with smoking and cancer is considerably higher,\u201d she said.\nBut, she added that avoiding processed meats altogether or only having them occasionally is a healthier diet. Instead of reaching for a hot dog or a sandwich with salami, Reidy-Lagunes said lean meats (like chicken) are the better option, along with proteins like fish, beans and nuts.\nCharred Foods\nIn today\u2019s \u201cwe can\u2019t have anything\u201d news, it turns out that while foods like grilled chicken and grilled fish are nutritious \u2014 they\u2019re high in protein and low in calories \u2014 putting something on the grill to the point that it chars can increase your cancer risk, according to Brawley.\n\u201cThe [char] has heterocyclic aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both are known carcinogens,\u201d he said. And this goes for grilled red meat, of course, but also for the healthier grilled items mentioned above.\nYou can still have grilled foods, but to reduce your cancer risk, Brawley said you shouldn\u2019t grill them to the point of charring. He added that, for this reason, he avoids meats that are really, really grilled.\nRed Meat\nDr. Chris Scuderi, a family physician in Jacksonville, Florida, and a cancer survivor, said he doesn\u2019t eat red meat because it can increase your risk of certain kinds of cancer. \u201cI haven\u2019t had meat in 12 years,\u201d Scuderi said.\nLlor agreed and added that red meat is something that he consumes rarely because of its cancer risk and cardiovascular risk (red meat consumption is linked to heart disease).\nSpecifically, studies show that red meat is linked to a higher probability of colorectal cancer and, according to MD Anderson Cancer Center, it also heightens the risk of prostate and pancreatic cancer.\nCereal And Other Sugary, Processed Foods\nLlor said he avoids foods that are ultra-processed, like cereal, because of the connection between processed foods and cancer. Additionally, he said he tries not to consume cakes and pastries for the same reason.\nWhile sugar doesn\u2019t directly influence cancer, it can increase other risk factors, like obesity (one of the leading risk factors for many types of cancer) and Type 2 diabetes, which can also increase one\u2019s risk of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a diabetes and obesity link to cancer,\u201d Brawley said. According to a 2018 study (Brawley is a co-author of the study), 7.8% of cancers are due to excess body weight.\nIn addition, a British study of 200,000 people found that those who consumed ultra-processed foods (like cereal and cakes) may have a higher risk of developing cancer.\nScuderi said he also avoids processed items.\n\u201cI\u2019m a cancer survivor, so I pay close attention to my diet, and also avoid processed and packaged foods as much as possible, and eat as cleanly as possible,\u201d Scuderi added.\nWhite Bread\n\u201cThe thing that I avoid as much as possible, and I don\u2019t avoid it 100%, [is] white bread,\u201d Brawley added.\nWhen asked why, Brawley explained that white bread has no nutritional benefit that you can\u2019t get with whole-grain bread. And, similar to cereal and sugary foods, it\u2019s linked to cancer risk factors like diabetes and obesity.\nSoda And Other Sugary Drinks\n\u201cI also, by the way, do not drink sugary beverages,\u201d Brawley said. This is again because of the lack of nutritional value and the high caloric value.\nLlor added that soft drinks and sugary beverages are also something he rarely consumes.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/most-dangerous-foods_l_643068d1e4b0859acb93fdf8": "Food inspectors see a lot of gnarly food.\nAlso referred to as food safety managers and food science technicians, these professionals are tasked with enforcing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidelines across companies to ensure that all matters related to food meet important standards \u2014 not just how the fare is made, but also how it\u2019s sourced, packaged, stored, dealt with over time and distributed all over the country. These folks makes it easy for us to buy groceries without having to worry too much about what\u2019s safe.\nWhen you hear about salmonella and E. coli breakouts, for example, it\u2019s because a food safety inspector was able to recognize and isolate the issue, a job that requires different levels of training depending on where in the United States you\u2019re looking to practice.\nSo if there\u2019s a food at the supermarket that you should avoid, a food safety inspector is the first person you should ask. We reached out and asked them what, exactly, they won\u2019t shop for when they\u2019re at the grocery store.\nUnpasteurized (Raw) Milk\nAlso known as raw milk, unpasteurized milk is milk that has not gone through a heating process as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that kills pathogens, extends shelf life and makes the drink safer for consumption.\nAs a result, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, raw milk may boast harmful germs like salmonella, E. coli, listeria, brucella and more.\nInterestingly enough, the sale of raw milk is actually illegal in some states. The Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund offers a pretty nifty state-by-state breakdown. In Alabama and Colorado, for example, the ban on raw milk extends to retail store sales, off-farm sales and on-farm ones. On the other hand, in California, Maine, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, among others, it is permissible to sell raw milk.\nThat being said, food safety regulators tend to stay away from the drink.\n\u201cAlthough it is possible to purchase raw, unpasteurized milk in some states, I recommend people not consume it,\u201d said professor Kali Kniel, a microbiologist at the University of Delaware who also explained that when a product is actually contaminated with a pathogenic microbe, the food won\u2019t smell or look different for the most part. So a \u201csniff test\u201d of raw milk won\u2019t indicate whether it would be safe for consumption.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who tout [raw] milk as having all these health benefits, but it\u2019s just not worth the risk because there are a lot of pathogenic organisms that are still alive in that milk, especially if it\u2019s coming straight from a processing facility,\u201d said Dr. Bryan Quoc Le, a food chemist and industry consultant based in Washington state.\nRaw Sprouts\nAccording to the experts, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily entirely stay away from sprouts (think radish, alfalfa and clover, for example \u2015 not Brussels sprouts), but, given that the food may be a source of harmful bacteria like E. coli and salmonella, it\u2019s important you wash all products thoroughly before eating them. (According to the FDA, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to use soap or a produce wash but plain running water is fine.\u201d)\n\u201cIn order for sprouts to germinate, the seeds cannot be adequately disinfected to kill all the salmonella that could be there, for example,\u201d Kniel explained. \u201cBut, in saying this, let\u2019s keep in mind that there are sprouts growers who are doing a great job and pay close attention to cleaning and sanitation.\u201d\nLe\u2019s outlook is a bit more cautious. \u201cThere seem to be more foodborne issues with sprouts and I think that is because of the desire not to use chemicals because of the type of consumers who like to buy them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe probability of contamination is not so high, it\u2019s more of a moderate risk, but I personally would avoid them.\u201d\nPre-cut Produce\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to eat pre-cut produce raw, you are dealing with the same amount of microbial risk as you would with sprouts,\u201d Le said. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t know what the person behind the counter has done while cutting the produce and what practices they implement. Packaged food, by law, has to go through a stringent process but food that has been produced on-site doesn\u2019t necessarily.\u201d\nKniel warns against cut melons in particular as they tend to support quick bacteria growth. Melons are most susceptible to contamination for a variety of reasons: They grow on the ground and can therefore soak and trap infected water throughout its harvesting process. On the ground, they can also come into contact with bacteria from animal feces that share space with them. Finally, the skin of the melon or cantaloupe lends itself to bacteria growth as the pathogens can easily stick to it and, perhaps, penetrate the rind.\nThat being said, when it comes to produce \u2014 pre-cut or whole \u2014 both experts suggest washing everything thoroughly prior to ingestion, storing all in the fridge, consuming the fare within a few days of purchase and, perhaps, considering cooking it instead of eating it raw.\nHot Food Bars (With A Caveat)\nWhen it comes to hot food bars at delis, supermarkets and the like, experts tend to look at the conditions of where the prepared food is kept over what is actually being offered.\nRule number one: All food should be maintained at a hot temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or below 41 degrees Ferenheit if being kept cold in order to properly fend off any potential bacterial growth.\n\u201cIf the heating system is questionable, I would avoid the hot food bar,\u201d Le advised. \u201cBut if it is kept above the proper temperature then you are OK eating it because it can\u2019t be contaminated.\u201d\nKniel agrees with that assessment and offers a few more tips to keep in mind while at the hot food bar. \u201cI look to see that the sneeze guard is in place and clean and that tongs are clean and available,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see that the tongs are being handled carefully by my fellow consumers.\u201d\nKniel also mentions keeping turnover in mind. When visiting a hot food bar during lunch or dinner hours, for example, you can expect the offerings to be replenished pretty often. If considering grabbing some fare during \u201coff hours,\u201d you might want to think about the fact that the \u201cfoods may have been sitting there longer and you may be more careful with your choices.\u201d\nOther Things To Keep An Eye (And A Nose) Out For\nThis one should come as no surprise: If you notice packaged food that looks unsafe or smells bad, stay away from it.\n\u201cConsumers should look at the integrity of packaged foods to be sure the packages are not compromised in any way,\u201d Kniel said, specifically advising to stay away from dented cans, as well. \u201cIn terms of food safety, if a meat or seafood product smells \u2018bad\u2019 or too fishy then it may be spoiled and those should be avoided. Also: Check the sell-by dates on the fresh produce packages to help you understand when the quality may start to deteriorate unless you are going to eat it right away. This is good for bagged salads, which actually have a long shelf life.\u201d\nRegarding fruits in particular, the expert doesn\u2019t purchase bruised products and, when selecting berries, looks for packages that are free of molds by checking the underside of the container.\nBonus Tip: Wash Your Reusable Shopping Bags\nWhen stocking up pantries and fridges, most shoppers keep safety-related issues in mind while actually selecting foods at the store, but, according to Kniel, the conscientiousness should go further than that.\n\u201cOne important consideration today is the reusable grocery totes that many people use,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, suggesting that consumers clean and wash the totes after and in-between shopping trips and, perhaps even more importantly, avoid using them for other tasks. \u201cFor example, don\u2019t place soccer cleats in a bag one day and then fresh produce in it the next day without appropriate cleaning \u2014 or just don\u2019t do that at all.\u201d Cross-contamination is a real thing.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-does-an-antibacterial-cutting-board-do_l_644fed8be4b0d840388feb33": "Take a look at any cooking show, restaurant kitchen or Instagram food influencer and you\u2019ll see a variety of cutting boards, with everyone having their own allegiance to a certain material. Some prefer hard plastic, whereas others love wood or bamboo.\nBut if you\u2019re concerned about food safety, which type of cutting board is the most sanitary?\nA new label has recently entered the conversation: antibacterial cutting boards. But before spending money on yet another cutting board, we wondered: Do you really need an antibacterial cutting board? What does that mean, exactly? We spoke with some food safety experts, and here\u2019s what they had to say.\nWhat is an antibacterial cutting board, anyway?\nWhile antibacterial cutting boards come in many materials, some are naturally antibacterial and some are synthetic. One goal they have in common is eliminating pathways for bacteria to live on the surface, or in cracks and crevices.\n\u201cIn general, cutting boards come in different materials, including thin or thick plastic, wood, glass, metal, bamboo, pressed wood or stone,\u201d explained Trevor Craig, a food safety expert at Microbac Laboratories. Many antibacterial boards have \u201ccoating or material that creates environments that do not support the growth or survival of bacteria.\u201d\nWhile some antibacterial cutting boards are plastic, there are steel and wooden ones, too. Antibacterial boards can\u2019t be damaged as easily as cheaper boards, and without cracks for bacteria to hide in, germs can\u2019t survive a good cleaning as easily.\nBefore purchasing an antibacterial cutting board, Craig said you should know that \u201csome materials, like wood, already have natural antimicrobial effects.\u201d\nWood with antimicrobials can kill off mold, mildew and other microbes in addition to bacteria. A 1994 study in the Journal of Food Protection found no trace of dangerous bacteria intentionally applied to wooden cutting boards and allowed to soak into the wood.\nHow many cutting boards do I need?\nAlthough owning an antibacterial cutting board is good step to ensuring food safety, you shouldn\u2019t stop there. To stay safe from cross-contamination, it\u2019s advised that you have more than one board \u2015 at the very least, one for meat and another for vegetables and fruit, said food scientist Bryan Quoc Le.\n\u201cFruits and vegetables are usually consumed raw. If meat were to be used on the same board, there could be contamination,\u201d Le said.\nHow do I sanitize my cutting board?\nEven with two boards, it\u2019s essential to clean them thoroughly. Many are now dishwasher-safe.\n\u201cWooden cutting boards should be hand washed, but most plastic or metal boards can go into the dishwasher,\u201d Craig said. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAll cutting boards, including antibacterial ones, should be washed regularly with soap and water. But if you want to take it further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests washing your boards with diluted bleach \u2015 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water.\nWhen should I replace my cutting board?\n\u201cPlastic cutting boards should be replaced once every one to five years,\u201d Le said. \u201cFor wooden cutting boards, they can be replaced once they are warped or have excessive large grooves from water damage, which can trap mold and bacteria.\u201d\nThe USDA and the Food and Drug Administration both suggest replacing your cutting boards, no matter the material, when you notice they have become excessively worn, or have hard-to-clean cracks. This includes cutting boards that claim to be antibacterial.\nBelow, we rounded up some antibacterial cutting board options to consider. They can make great gifts for your next shower or housewarming. Or, if you need a new one for yourself, look no further than right here.\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Sometimes, you just need a slice of pizza, a cold can of Diet Coke or some milk and cookies, and that\u2019s OK, too.\nWe talked to physicians in fields including family medicine, cardiology, internal medicine, public health, dermatology and plastic surgery who told us about ways they balance their own nutritional lives. One good example is Dr. Femi Akinnagbe, a resident physician in family medicine at Harbor-UCLA Family Medicine in Los Angeles. Four to six days a week, he exercises and meditates. \u201cI find those practices are not only good for my health but essential in my daily stress reduction,\u201d he said. But, he said, there are moments when he takes a different approach.\nHe admitted there are times when \u201cgymming and sitting in silence don\u2019t totally get me to the equanimous state of being that allows me to navigate the world from a state of inner repose,\u201d and, for those occasions, \u201cI spend some quality time with my two therapists, Ben & Jerry. In my younger days, I could polish off a whole pint of cold, creamy goodness in one sitting. After treating countless patients with diabetes, I\u2019ve cut back on my habit to just a couple of spoonfuls when I do indulge.\u201d\nSweet Cravings\nMany of the doctors we spoke with admitted to having a sweet tooth that occasionally needs attention. Facial plastic surgeon Dr. Babak Azizzadeh savors Italian gelato with a wafer cookie. \u201cI usually have it about once a week when I\u2019m home in Los Angeles, but I enjoy it daily when I\u2019m in vacation mode,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reminds me of walking around in Florence and other parts of Italy when I was on a backpacking trip through Europe during medical school.\u201d\nAnother plastic surgeon, Dr. Mark G. Albert, follows a vegan diet fairly closely, describing himself as a \u201ccasual endurance athlete.\u201d Still, every month or two, when he finds himself in a pharmacy, he buys peanut butter cups. \u201cIt reminds me of my childhood, and there\u2019s nothing better than finding one with especially crunchy chocolate on the outside and fresh peanut butter on the inside,\u201d he said.\nAnd of course, it\u2019s always good to leave room for chocolate. Dr. Nsisong Asanga, a physician with a background in public health and field epidemiology, enjoys chocolate on special occasions. \u201cNutrition, celebration and enjoyment are cool, but guilt is useless,\u201d she said.\nDermatologist Dr. Mojgan Hosseinipour is also an unabashed chocolate aficionado. \u201cI like dark chocolate with raspberries, the perfect mix of bitter and sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to eat mostly plant-based, whole food recipes, and I avoid processed foods and foods with a high glycemic index that can spike blood sugar. But sometimes I crave chips, cookies or ice cream, and that\u2019s OK, as long as it\u2019s not a daily habit.\u201d\nFamily Favorites\nSometimes our favorite foods are connected to family moments. For Dr. Rich Joseph, whose clinical practice focuses on obesity and metabolic health, pizza night is an important family ritual. \u201cMy whole family loves pizza, especially my two young kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing their eyes light up when pizza boxes come through our front door is priceless. I want them to have a healthy relationship with food and learn to eat things they enjoy mindfully, without guilt and in moderation.\u201d\nFamily medicine physician Dr. Faisel Syed sets aside time with his sons for an after-dinner ritual of cookies and milk. \u201cIt\u2019s become a time for us to connect, laugh and enjoy each other\u2019s company,\u201d he said. \u201cBy no means am I encouraging indulging in unhealthy foods, but this is more about finding balance and joy in the little things in life. It feeds my soul.\u201d\nCheers To Beer And Diet Coke\nDr. Deirdre Mattina, a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic, follows the Mediterranean diet and doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. But there\u2019s one indulgence she allows herself: a daily can of Diet Coke. \u201cI have a lifelong obsession with that drink,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all choose our vices, and I struggle with this one, but no one can pry that cold can out of my hand.\u201d\nAs they work their way through long hours, a refreshing beverage is often welcome. For plastic surgeon and associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School Dr. Samuel Lin, a favorite workday beverage is bubble tea. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pick-me-up when I\u2019m seeing patients in the office all day,\u201d he said.\nAfter hours and when they\u2019re not on call, some doctors prefer a potent potable. Dr. Bradley Serwer is an interventional cardiologist who said he maintains a cardiac healthy diet \u201c98% of the time.\u201d Still, he makes room for a double IPA once or twice a month. He realizes that \u201cwe meet with friends for drinks or dinner, not to survive, but to connect on a social level, and an occasional \u2018guilty pleasure\u2019 is part of that.\u201d\nNostalgic Foods That Taste Like Home\nFood that tastes \u201clike home\u201d can be nourishing for more than just our physical selves. Dr. Reid Maclellan is an adjunct faculty member at Harvard Medical School, with expertise in vascular anomalies and lymphedema. His treat of choice, he said, is whiskey. \u201cI\u2019m both Scottish and a Tennessean, so whiskey is part of my culture,\u201d he said. \u201cHosting friends and family over a dram is always a wonderful bonding experience.\u201d\nAnother cultural connection is made by internal medicine physician Dr. Simon Pimstone, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia. He savors a taste of his native South Africa with the beef-jerky-like national snack known as biltong, which he described as \u201cmy absolute indulgence.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, verging on addictive,\u201d he added.\nDr. Joon Lee practices functional, integrative and obesity medicine. For her, a cherished nighttime snack is Korean spicy shin ramen. While acknowledging that it\u2019s a \u201cspice, salt and carbohydrate bomb,\u201d she said that eating a hot bowlful \u201cbrings me back to childhood memories of my mom cooking ramen for me when I got hungry studying in the middle of the night,\u201d she said. \u201cIt not only fills my belly, but satisfies my inner core of being Korean. We need fresh whole food for our bodies, but sometimes \u2014 just sometimes \u2014 certain foods reward our hard work or reconnect us to our roots.\u201d\nAll Things In Moderation\nAs you\u2019re navigating your own balance for nutrition and health, consider this practical advice from Akinnagbe: \u201cI actually like to partake in treats like ice cream and beer from time to time, because it reminds me to not take myself too seriously. If you were to ask my co-workers, friends and family, they would all tell you I\u2019m a super healthy, fit guy. While that\u2019s true, sometimes having that reputation can become a little confining.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, making healthy dietary and exercise choices is essential for good health and a long life,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, sometimes it just feels good to not always be \u2018on point\u2019 and just allow myself the opportunity to indulge.\u201d",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eco-friendly-grilling-tips_l_6447f706e4b0408f3e55b848": "While the perks of outdoor grilling are legion, it can leave behind some less-than-appealing effects on the environment. Studies show that charcoal grills in particular release substantial carbon dioxide into the air with each use, and the cumulative effect of these greenhouse gasses contributes to global warming and climate change.\nAlso, demand for charcoal (which is made from burnt wood) can promote deforestation and release further greenhouse emissions from the charcoal-making process (the burning of large quantities of wood produces carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane).\nAll of this together can diminish the goal that chef Sarah Glover recommends for all outdoor grillers: \u201cLeave the space better than you found it and never take for granted what you get from being outdoors.\u201d\nTo find out how to have an enjoyable summer barbecue while causing the least-possible damage to your natural surroundings, we asked professional grill chefs and eco-conscious cookware experts to give us their top tips on eco-friendly grilling.\nSeek out high-quality pure lump charcoal.\nCharcoal briquettes are popular among home grillers, since they\u2019re easy to light without the aid of lighter fluid and provide even heat to the grill. However, these composite chunks, which contain wood chips and sawdust, are often held together with chemical additives that extend their burn time and help them maintain their shape. Those additives also can release additional emissions into the air.\nChef Luis Mata doesn\u2019t recommend briquettes for eco-conscious cooking. Instead, he said that \u201cthe key to making your charcoal grilling experience more eco-friendly is to use the highest quality lump charcoal you can get your hands on.\u201d\n\u201cLump charcoal\u201d is exactly what it sounds like: lump-shaped pieces of charcoal that haven\u2019t been chemically processed or shaped. It tends to be the preferred charcoal of barbecue pros, who cite the fact that it lights quickly, burns hot and leaves behind less residual ash than briquettes.\nFor an especially solid lump charcoal that\u2019s better for the environment, Mata recommends Binchotan, \u201ca Japanese crafted hardwood lump charcoal that\u2019s known as the purest in the world. It burns longer, hotter and cleaner than any other charcoal or briquette. It\u2019s also smokeless and odorless, and can be reused.\u201d\nSteer clear of lighter fluid.\nCharcoal (particularly lump charcoal) generally requires a fire starter to light. While petroleum lighter fluid is popular for this purpose, the experts we spoke to generally advise against it.\n\u201cLighter fluid is made of hydrocarbons, which can be toxic if ingested and could cause symptoms such as stomach or throat pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing and skin or eye irritation,\u201d said Ben Jablonski, CEO and co-founder of The Good Charcoal. \u201cFurthermore, the smoke given off by lighter fluid-soaked coals contributes to air pollution.\u201d\nThe University of Illinois Sustainable Technology Center backs up these claims, stating that \u201clighter fluid causes air pollution, such as polycystic aromatic hydrocarbon, when burned.\u201d\nPima County, Arizona, issued a warning about the use of lighter fluid on grills in 2016, noting that, when \u201cmixed with intense solar radiation and other pollutants, the chemicals in lighter fluid create a pollutant called ground-level ozone. Elevated levels of ground-level ozone can affect children, people who work or exercise outside, the elderly and people with lung or heart disease, including asthma and congestive heart failure.\u201d\nHealth issues that can come from ground-level ozone exposure include coughing, difficulty breathing and heightened vulnerability of the lungs, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nGlover recommends using \u201cnatural fire lighter fluids \u2014 or, even better, get an ax and split your own wood into small kindling so you don\u2019t have to use fire-lighting fluid at all.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re using kindling, invest in a charcoal chimney starter to speed along the charcoal-lighting process.\nIf possible, switch to a natural gas grill.\nCharcoal grills have a serious cult following among grilling enthusiasts, but they\u2019re not the only game in town. If you want to really optimize your eco-friendly grilling practices, consider ditching the charcoal in favor of a natural gas grill. Because of their very low emissions, wide availability and moderate price point, the Sierra Club calls natural gas grills \u201cthe most realistically eco-friendly option\u201d for most home grillers.\nPrevent flare-ups with catch pans or aluminum foil.\nFire breakouts on a grill can be alarming for many reasons, but an underrated one involves the fact that they release more smoke \u2014 and, therefore, more toxins \u2014 than necessary into the environment, according to chef Ron Stewart.\nTo lessen the risk of flare-ups, take Stewart\u2019s advice and \u201cput aluminum foil below your meat so that any dripping fat does not land directly on the coals/embers. You should also consider either investing in an inexpensive catch pan designed for catching grease drippings or using a heavy-duty aluminum foil tray underneath your food during cooking to safely collect excess fats before they fall onto coals/burner elements.\u201d\nShut down the grill as soon as you\u2019re done cooking.\nFor an easy way to cut back on emissions, turn off the grill as soon as your food is ready.\n\u201cWhen using charcoal, most people will let their coals burn down and out when done cooking, which can take hours,\u201d Jablonski said. \u201cThe result is hours of charcoal emissions emitted with no further purpose. The solution is quite simple: When you are done cooking, simply close the lid to the grill and shut any vents or baffles. This will very quickly stifle the lit coals and leave a basket of slightly used charcoal ready for your next grilling encounter.\u201d\nBriquettes should be thrown in the garbage, but lump charcoal can be repurposed as fertilizer.\nWhile briquettes with synthetic materials should be thrown in landfill garbage after use, Jablonski told us that lump charcoal can often be reused if it hasn\u2019t burned down completely. But after the second grill cycle, it\u2019s time to figure out where to dispose of those residual bits and ash.\nJablonski has a simple and eco-friendly solution: \u201cAs long as you use an additive-free wood charcoal, you can use it as fertilizer. The ash contains potash (potassium carbonate), which is nutritious for many plants. Potash can also increase the pH levels in your soil, but depending on what you\u2019re growing, you want to use it sparingly. Don\u2019t use charcoal ash with acid-loving plants (like blueberries, azaleas and hydrangeas), nor newly planted seedlings and seeds.\u201d\nAs an alternative, Jablonski said that tossing a few pieces of used lump charcoal into your compost pile can help the entire composting process.\n\u201cCharcoal increases the carbon content\u201d of the compost pile, he said. \u201cCarbon is important to provide energy to microorganisms while they break down the organic matter in compost.\u201d",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-skin-dermatologists_l_645403d4e4b00eb7e63a3c4a": "If you\u2019re like me, you grew up hearing all kinds of questionable advice about what you should and shouldn\u2019t eat if you want clear, glowing skin. The \u201cchocolate causes acne\u201d myth is one that is oft-repeated, but blessedly, it\u2019s been found to be more urban legend than empirically proven fact.\nWhen it comes to the human body, few things are as simple as \u201cX causes Y\u201d \u2014 cutting out or adding any given food is unlikely to be the magic bullet for beautiful skin. But there are some links between diet and skin health that are backed by reliable evidence.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPatients commonly ask about dietary modifications to help improve their skin or control certain skin diseases,\u201d said Dr. Tiffany J. Libby, a Rhode Island-based board-certified dermatologist. \u201cThe short answer is that diet can absolutely affect your skin, and we are learning more about the responsible pathways for how it does so.\u201d\nAs a result, there are some foods you\u2019re not likely to catch certain dermatologists eating for lunch. We spoke to several skin docs about the foods they do and don\u2019t eat for the sake of their skin. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all prescription for skin health, but keep reading for guidelines these dermatologists use in their own lives.\nDairy\nToday\u2019s milk mustache could be tomorrow\u2019s breakout. Several of the doctors we spoke to say they severely limit their intake of dairy products, if not cut them out altogether.\n\u201cDairy products, especially high-fat milk, and cheese, contain hormones that can trigger acne in some people,\u201d said Dr. Yoram Harth, a board-certified dermatologist. \u201cMilk contains an androgen precursor that can increase oil production and clog pores, while cheese contains a high amount of saturated fat, leading to inflammation in the body and skin.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThere is actually a pretty substantial body of research that links acne and dairy consumption, especially milk itself \u2014 whole, low-fat and skim milk included. Researchers haven\u2019t figured out why, exactly, but some hypothesize that the proteinwhey is to blame. If you struggle with breakouts, you might want to consider cutting back on (or eliminating) milk and other dairy-based foods.\nFried Foods\nIt probably doesn\u2019t come as much of a shock to hear that many dermatologists advise to stay away from oily, fried foods like doughnuts, fried chicken and french fries.\n\u201cFried foods are often high in unhealthy fats, particularly trans fats and saturated fats,\u201d said Dr. Asmi Sanghvi, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. She mentioned, first and foremost, that these kinds of fats can impact your overall health \u2015 but the effects might show up on your skin, too.\n\u201cFrom a skin health perspective, research has shown that diets high in unhealthy fats may contribute to inflammation in the body, including the skin,\u201d Sanghvi said. \u201cInflammation is a common factor in many skin conditions, including acne, psoriasis and eczema. A diet high in unhealthy fats may also contribute to the breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin, leading to premature aging and the development of wrinkles.\u201d\nSoda\nThis one isn\u2019t terribly surprising, but several of the doctors we interviewed specifically called out soda as something they never or rarely consume. The primary reason for that, Sanghvi said, is the high sugar content present in most sodas.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cConsuming large amounts of sugar can lead to increased inflammation throughout the body, which can exacerbate skin conditions such as acne, rosacea and eczema,\u201d Sanghvi said. \u201cSugar can damage collagen and elastin fibers in the skin, which can contribute to wrinkles and premature aging.\u201d\nSanghvi said sugar-free sodas aren\u2019t a good alternative, because \u201dartificial sweeteners interfere with the body\u2019s normal signals that control hunger and satiety,\u201d increasing the risk that you might consume more sugar. She recommends skipping stevia, aspartame, sucralose and sugar alcohols like xylitol and maltitol in favor of natural sweeteners like monk fruit, honey or maple syrup.\nOf course, anything that\u2019s high in sugar can cause inflammation and contribute to signs of aging, not just soda. But, if you\u2019re a big soda drinker, the beverages contain something else you should watch out for.\n\u201cMany sodas contain caffeine, which can dehydrate the body and leave the skin looking dry and dull,\u201d Sanghvi said. \u201cDehydration can also lead to an impaired skin barrier, which can make the skin more susceptible to environmental damage and skin irritations.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSanghvi advises people to skip sugary drinks, including soda, as much as possible and hydrate with water instead.\nRefined Carbohydrates (Pasta, Bread)\nAlmost every doctor we spoke to mentioned that they try to limit their consumption of refined carbs like pasta, bread and white rice. Libby pointed out that these foods, like sugary drinks and desserts, have a high glycemic index.\n\u201cHigh glycemic index [foods] (i.e., white rice, white bread, sugary beverages, etc.) and dairy are examples of proposed dietary triggers for acne,\u201d Libby said.\nHigh glycemic index foods are ones the body is able to break down quickly, which can lead to spikes in blood glucose. There is some evidence linking low glycemic diets to reductions in acne; the American Academy of Dermatology Association notes that studies have not yet proved a causal relationship between high glycemic diets and acne, but there may be a link. Doctors and researchers hypothesize that high glycemic foods can cause inflammation as well as increased production of sebum (an oil produced by your skin).\n\u201cI, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone, love my pastas, but try to eat them in moderation as these certainly fall in the high glycemic index chart for foods,\u201d Libby said. \u201cI try to look for foods that fall lower on the glycemic index (< 55) such as most fruits and vegetables, beans, minimally processed grains, pasta, low-fat dairy foods and nuts.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCured And Processed Meats\nDr. Roberta Del Campo, a Miami-based board-certified dermatologist, pinpointed cured and processed meats as a group of foods that she avoids. Cured and processed meats, like hot dogs, sausages, bacon, pepperoni and salami, are frequently red-flagged by medical professionals because they\u2019re linked to serious illnesses like heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and several different cancers. If that weren\u2019t reason enough to skip sausages, Del Campo says the nitrates in cured and processed meats can have a negative effect on skin health, as well.\n\u201cI avoid eating foods that are high in nitrates such as bacon, ham and hot dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cNitrates are known to increase inflammation throughout the body. Skin is our biggest organ and inflammation can wreak havoc on it.\u201d\nInflammation is the body\u2019s natural immune response to injury or infection, and depending on the cause, it can manifest in the form of swelling, pain, fatigue or even psoriasis. The direct relationship between cured meats and skin health hasn\u2019t been extensively studied in clinical settings, but knowing what effects they can have on overall health, there\u2019s good reason to be wary.\nFermented Foods, Citrus and Spinach (For Some People)\nIf you have a skin condition that causes itching, like eczema or rosacea, some seemingly innocuous foods could be contributing to your symptoms. Fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha, citrus fruits, and even eggplant and spinach are all nutritionally rich foods, but they\u2019re also high in histamines \u2014 the compound that\u2019s activated in your body when you\u2019re having an allergic reaction. Typically, the body breaks down histamines with an enzyme called diamine oxidase, but if you\u2019re taking in histamines faster than your body can break them down, it may exacerbate preexisting skin conditions. Dejarra Sims, a San Diego-based naturopathic doctor with a focus in natural skin care, explained what some of her patients experience.\n\u201cUpon eating citrus they will have increased or new pimples, increased itching with hives and eczema, and increased redness and flushing with rosacea,\u201d she said. For those who do have this sensitivity, \u201cmost will know immediately once I teach them to start paying attention to their diet and see a resolution of symptoms within one to two hours after eating.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFor most people, however, histamine-rich foods won\u2019t have any effect, in which case you can eat all the oranges and kimchi your heart desires.\nWant a quicker fix to boost your glow?

I've seen a massive difference since I started using The Glow Maker! It makes my skin glow and has helped with dark spots. I am going to continue purchasing!\" \u2014 Robert S.\nThis French drugstore-brand moisturizer is everywhere these days, beloved by influencers, models, makeup artists and our own staff writer Tessa Flores. It has a sensitive-skin-friendly formula that includes calming aloe vera, protective beeswax, nourishing soy proteins and skin-softening shea butter.\nPromising review: \u201cI\u2019m 43 and live in Colorado and I\u2019m not kidding when I say I have tried 20+ moisturizers in the past few years trying to find something that works in the winter for my super fair, super sensitive skin. I tend to break out easily with certain ingredients and fragrances, also often deal with flaking/redness. It has been so hard to find something that is moisturizing ENOUGH that doesn\u2019t break out or irritate my skin, but still actually works. I\u2019ve tried so many Sephora lines as well as Biossance and Caudalie, numerous drugstore brands in all price ranges, but this cream is amazing. Moisturizing enough to use as a night cream but not so greasy that you can\u2019t wear it during the day under makeup, and super soothing for redness and irritation.\u201d \u2014 KaritaG\nBlack Girl Sunscreen moisturizing sunscreen lotion SPF 30\nSPF is a non-negotiable regardless of skin tone, but it's not easy to find formulas that don't leave a white cast. Makeup artist Kierra Lanice Wray just recently recommended Black Girl Sunscreen's lightweight hybrid formula. It's made with zinc oxide, aloe, lavender and shea butter and leaves skin dewy, soft, smooth and healthy \u2014 as well as protected.\nPromising review: \"I absolutely love this sunscreen and will forever repurchase it. It leaves my extremely dry skin looking super dewy. It is a necessary step before applying my makeup! The only downside for me personally is that i wish it was more than spf 30 but im looking to try their new hybrid formula that's spf 50.\" \u2014 Dom\nDr. Shari Sperling, a board-certified dermatologist at Sperling Dermatology in New York and New Jersey, told HuffPost previously, \"Retinol helps promote cell turnover, stimulate collagen, reduce discoloration and restore your skin\u2019s natural texture and tone. Differin, which used to be prescription-only but is now available over the counter, is a great product for acne and anti-aging.\" Use it to spot treat acne or all over to help prevent breakouts and help with overall skin health.\nPromising review: \"My dermatologist recommended this to me for the comedonal acne on my forehead. She said it could take up to 3 months to work, but within 7 days of using it, my forehead was mostly clear. I am thrilled and will keep using this from now on. I use a good moisturizer afterward and it hasn't been drying out my skin.\" \u2014 Olivia\nLaneige lip sleeping mask is a wildly popular lip mask and for good reason. It creates a seal on the lips that lets the product\u2019s hydrating ingredients soak in. Wake up to soft, hydrated and thoroughly nourished lips of your youth with minimal effort.\nPromising review: \"I absolutely love this lip mask. I've tried other ones and this one is just so soft and stays on well but doesn't feel sticky. The scent is nice and subtle. The chocolate one has a bit of a brown cast to it which does show more than the pinkish berry one. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little silicone tipped spatula thingy - it is so nice to use. I like using that so much more than using my fingers. My lips have been a lot softer since I've been using this regularly. Since the chocolate is smaller, I use that one for travel mainly and use the pink more for night time when I'm home.\" \u2014 Pandalu\nSimilarly to The Ordinary's exfoliating treatment, Paula's Choice uses a potent blend of BHAs to help gently resurface acne-prone, rough and dull skin. It can help to unclog pores, smooth wrinkles and even out skin tone. It's less abrasive than other treatments, and also hydrates and smoothes out skin without causing damage or irritation.\nPromising review: \"I had wanted to try this for a long time so I finally got the travel sized bottle to give it a go and it\u2019s been great. I disagree with the reviews saying it\u2019s tiny, it is small but it\u2019s the same ounces as my other serums but without the thick glass bottle and dropper. The travel sized bottle has lasted me a month at this point and has about a third left and I use it once a day. I would say if you used a cotton pad to apply it then it would probably go a lot quicker so I prefer to use my fingers immediately after washing my face. Anyways, this works miracles and hasn\u2019t dried my skin out yet when using with a Hyaluronic acid serum over top. I\u2019ve gotten compliments on my skin a lot and people thinking I\u2019m wearing foundation when I\u2019m not. I tried differin and tretinoin last year for several months each and never got results like this. I also am allergic to so so many cosmetics and this has yet to cause me to get the flaky rash that I so easily get around my mouth and eyes. My only tiny complaint might be that the texture can feel a smidge oily/heavy at first, but it really isn\u2019t too bad and it sinks in after about 10 minutes to where you wouldn\u2019t notice it more than any other skincare product. I also think I notice that less when I use it immediately after washing my face when my skin is still not totally dried out, which maybe helps it sink in quicker, I\u2019m not sure. I highly recommend giving this a try though. For $13 you would definitely have enough product to see some results before deciding to splurge on the full size.\" \u2014 Rhyann Wilson\nDr. Brendan Camp, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology in New York, noted that this mineral sunscreen is great for people who have breakout-prone skin. This is the tinted version, but you can also grab a clear one if you prefer a natural, clean slate. It doesn't clog pores or feel heavy and has a lovely soft finish that isn't too oily. It's the perfect combination of skin care and makeup.\nPromising review: \"I was prone to breakouts from other sunscreens which made me not want to wear them. Elta MD is a great dermatologist recommend sunscreen that keeps your pores clear while providing break protection and a tinted appearance. Great to wear alone or as a base layer in your make up routine. Will be buying again.\" \u2014 Madi\nAzelaic acid is a must for anyone hoping to reduce the look of dark spots and fade acne scarring, while also targeting active breakouts with the help of salicylic acid. It's a very effective, versatile serum that's available at a very reasonable price. Many reviewers also note that it works wonders for those with rosacea.\nPromising review: \"Great product. This cream is a perfect solution for oily parts of my face. It blurs pores and makes my skin tone even. It was a great preventive treatment for my acne as well.\" \u2014 Jane\nFirst Aid Beauty hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid\nLeave your skin bouncy and firm with this popular and highly-rated serum from First Aid Beauty. Camp stated that \"hyaluronic acid (HA) is normally found in skin, and functions to attract water molecules to keep skin moisturized. Using an HA serum at night helps skin recover from environmental stresses from the preceding day.\"\nPromising review: \"Bye bye wrinkles. I absolutely love their products. This hyraluronic Acid is the best non greasy fast absorbent. It leaves my skin looking bright. I love the way my face feels after using it and i can still apply my makeup after using without clumping or smearing. It has also done wonders for my aging neck. Get old stinks but this is making it a little less of a problem.\" \u2014 Kelly McConnell\nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% exfoliating peeling solution\nHardcore skin care devotees rave about The Ordinary's 10-minute chemical peel in a bottle. It's a blood-hued exfoliating treatment that can help with acne, skin texture and dullness. It harnesses the power of both AHAs and BHAs like glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid, which exfoliate the skin and pores to help reduce congestion.\nPromising review: \"Was skeptical given the price. This is a miracle product. I tried it before going to bed one night, not thinking it would do much and I realized when I looked in the mirror the next morning that my skin was visibly smoother and less textured. I chalked it up to good sleep but after it happened a couple more times after using this product I realized it\u2019s the serum that\u2019s making my skin look so good. I had my mom try it as well and she said the thing. It does sting a little when applied (do NOT apply to wet or damp skin- must be dry) but it\u2019s not bad at all for me. I use this weekly and my skin has never looked better!\" \u2014 barb99\nWhile a face mask might seem high-maintenance, there's a good chance you'll be able to find a way to pop it into your routine even just once or twice a week. This is a great option for those who want the luxury skin care experience but don't want to go into major debt trying to get the skin of their dreams. According to Sperling, \"this mask is soothing, anti-aging, hydrating and is great for all skin types, including dry/dehydrated skin. It leaves the skin looking and feeling refreshed.\"\nPromising review: \"After a year of use I cannot say enough good things about this product. I have a mix of dry and oily very sensitive skin. Most exfoliating products either give me hives, cause breakouts, burn, or leave the skin more dry than before. This product smells fantastic (pineapple/orange), is so unbelievably gentle, and leaves skin feeling clean and moisturized. It feels like a professional facial in a bottle. It's helped reduce breakouts and even out my skin tone as well. I use 1-2 times a week on a wet face after the shower before any other products or just in the shower after cleanser. Worth every penny even if you don't have an elaborate skin care regimen.\" \u2014 KayliJean\nNiacinamide is one of those wonderfully versatile antioxidants that generally works well with a range of skin types and addresses everything from uneven skin texture to signs of aging and excess oil production. This Inkey List serum has a whopping 20% concentration of niacinamide along with hydrating squalene and zinc to help balance it all out. As Dr. Carmen Castilla, a board-certified New York-based dermatologist, mentioned in a previous article, \"the 20% niacinamide concentration is relatively high and has the potential to be irritating. However, the formulation also has squalene, a fatty acid, which can help support the skin barrier and may prevent irritation.\"\nPromising review: \"New added product for my routine! So I have used this product for about 2 months ... It works! Before my face would be super oily and shiny at the end of the day, but when I would put this on every morning my face is completely not oily! it really works very well, a good bit will be good and it will be a little tacky. Put it on after all your serums and before your moisturizer.\" \u2014 ClearCleanBeaut\nFor anyone seeking deep, restorative hydration, this barrier repair cream is a must. It's great for dry patches, irritated skin and anyone who needs to add an extra dollop of moisture to their routine. Colloidal oatmeal and beta glucan soothe, reduce redness, smooth and support skin's natural barrier. It's just as nourishing and effective as pricey creams like SkinFix and Sunday Riley, but it won't leave you panicking about the cost.\nPromising review: \"Love love love this moisturizer!! It has such a rich and balmy texture that relieves the dryness on my skin the second I put it on.\" \u2014 hafsamlb",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthier-ice-cream-brands_l_63fe5ee3e4b0db7a1f686277": "When it comes to ice cream, the options in the freezer aisle of your grocery store are myriad these days, from full-fat dairy-based ice creams to brands like Halo Top that pack a surprisingly small number of calories (along with ingredients like erythritol, xylitol and guar gum). When it comes to what\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d and what\u2019s not, there are a lot of factors at play.\nIn recent years, conversations about nutrition have shifted in a really positive direction, with support for mindful eating replacing old, harmful ideas about \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d foods. After all, eating foods that bring you pleasure \u201ccan catapult the brain into feeling happier and more positive, thanks to the surge of serotonin, which is considered essential and healthy,\u201d said Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, a New York City-based registered dietician and author.\nIce cream falls into this category, and \u201chealthy\u201d ice cream options can include low-sugar and dairy-free versions, as well as full-fat and dairy ice creams eaten in moderation.\nWe asked dieticians, nutritionists and doctors to recommend the healthiest ice creams sold at grocery stores, and they provided these eight suggestions, all available nationwide.\nHaagen-Dazs Ice Cream\nIt\u2019s easy to be skeptical about the idea that full-fat dairy ice cream can be worked into a healthy diet, but our experts overwhelmingly agreed that it\u2019s very possible, as long as you pay close attention to the ingredients. Caroline Young, the registered dietician behind Whole Self Nutrition, argued that these ice creams \u201care typically the best options, unless you have a dairy allergy or intolerance. I find full-fat dairy to be the most satiating option, which makes sense, because fat is the main nutrient that makes food satisfying!\u201d\nWhen helping clients interpret ingredient lists and figure out which treats to add to their diets, Dr. Lisa Oldson, a physician specializing in internal medicine and obesity medicine who\u2019s also an instructor at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, urges them to pick \u201cdesserts made with actual food, rather than ultra-processed versions of dessert.\u201d\nOldson finds that many lower-calorie, dairy-free brands use additives and artificial components, and these chemical ingredients make it easy to overeat (since they\u2019re not as satisfying and hearty as natural ingredients) and can also put consumers at risk for \u201cother health problems, including diabetes and dementia.\u201d\nOldson recommends Haagen-Dazs as her top ice cream choice for a healthy diet, since this brand uses only \u201ccream, skim milk, cane sugar, egg yolks and vanilla extract\u201d to make vanilla ice cream.\nElizabeth Quinn, a certified nutritionist and the creator of Whole Story Nutrition, agreed. \u201cHaagen-Dazs only uses eggs to stabilize their dairy products,\u201d she said, so there are no gums (processed stabilizers). \u201cTheir ingredient lists are clean and natural. They do not use rBST-treated milk or cream,\u201d Quinn added.\nA 2/3-cup serving of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream contains 320 calories, 25 total grams of sugar, 21 total grams of fat and 6 grams of protein. Each pint container includes 2.5 servings.\nHalo Top Ice Cream\nThe rise of Halo Top in the frozen dessert world has been very noteworthy. In 2017, Halo Top earned the title of the most popular ice cream pint in the United States.\nWhile some of our experts expressed concern about Halo Top\u2019s artificial and processed ingredients (including synthetic sweeteners and coloring agents), Katherine Gomez, a registered dietician and medical reviewer at Psychemag, finds that Halo Top can be healthily incorporated into a balanced diet because the brand\u2019s \u201cunique flavors include dairy, nondairy and keto options.\u201d\n\u201cIt is creamy ice cream with low calories and no sugar,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIt is also gluten-free, kosher and protein-rich.\u201d\nA 2/3-cup serving of Halo Top vanilla bean ice cream contains 100 calories, 7 total grams of sugar, 2 total grams of fat and 6 grams of protein. Each container includes 3 servings.\nTalenti Gelato\nGelato, the Italian version of ice cream, features numerous benefits from a health perspective. It contains less air than ice cream, which gives it a silkier texture. Some frozen-dessert fans assume that gelato\u2019s richer mouthfeel and more concentrated flavors mean this product contains more fat and sugar than standard ice cream, but the exact opposite is true.\nTalenti gelato, which can be found at grocery stores nationwide, \u201cis slow-churned, [so] it has a creamy texture and reduced fat,\u201d said Erin Lehman, a registered dietician who\u2019s a diabetes care and education specialist with Arden Nutrition. Talenti is lower-fat, lower-calorie, and just as satisfying and indulgent as any full-fat dairy ice cream out there.\nA 2/3-cup serving of Talenti Madagascan vanilla bean gelato contains 260 calories, 30 total grams of sugar, 13 total grams of fat and 5 grams of protein. Each container includes 3 servings.\nArctic Zero Ice Cream\nArctic Zero has made a real name for itself in the nondairy ice cream space, thanks to its sizable range of flavors, widespread distribution and creamy texture that\u2019s very close to that of \u201creal\u201d ice cream.\nIt\u2019s a favorite brand of Mary Sabat, registered dietician, certified trainer and creator of Body Designs by Mary. It\u2019s made from purified water, organic cane sugar, allulose (a naturally occurring sweetener with fewer calories than sugar), sugar cane fiber, faba bean protein concentrate, gum blend, natural flavors, sea salt and monk fruit concentrate.\n\u201cThese plant based ingredients make for a higher protein product with less sugar and more fiber,\u201d Sabat said.\nIn terms of pure numbers, Sabat points to the low calorie count and high nutritional value of a reasonably sized portion: \u201cEach 2/3-cup serving contains 50 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein and 0 grams of fat.\u201d\nAlec\u2019s Ice Cream\n\u201cOrganic\u201d might feel like a buzzword with little meaning these days, but ice cream that genuinely meets the U.S. Department of Agriculture standard of organic (made using milk harvested from pasture-fed cows that aren\u2019t given growth hormones or antibiotic treatments) can easily be incorporated into a health-conscious, additive-free diet.\nPooja Mahtani, a functional medicine clinical nutritionist, considers Alec\u2019s Ice Cream, which makes dairy ice cream with organic milk, a prime example of healthy dairy-based ice cream.\n\u201cAlec\u2019s sources dairy from organic and pasture-raised cows, and contains a moderate amount of sugar compared to other brands on the market,\u201d Mahtani told us. \u201cFurther, there are no preservatives or additives in this ice cream.\u201d\nA 2/3-cup serving of Alec\u2019s Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream contains 270 calories, 23 total grams of sugar, 18 total grams of fat and 5 grams of protein. Each container includes 2.5 servings.\nCado Avocado Frozen Dessert\nBy using avocado as its core ingredient, Cado Avocado Frozen Dessert manages to create a plant-based ice cream that\u2019s rich and creamy while also being vegan-friendly and packed with healthy vitamins.\n\u201cI would consider an ice cream \u2018healthy\u2019 [if it is] higher in protein than others and lower in sugar than others, while also offering some micronutrients,\u201d explained Morgyn Clair, a registered dietician and a health writer for Fit Healthy Momma. Cado, she said, fits into all of these categories because it \u201chas lower sugar than other choices, [it\u2019s] high in healthy fats and fiber, and Vitamin E is present from the avocados.\u201d\nA 1/2-cup serving of Cado nondairy vanilla bean frozen dessert contains 170 calories, 12 total grams of sugar, 11 total grams of fat and 0 grams of protein. Each container includes 3 servings.\nBen & Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream\nBen & Jerry\u2019s, the delightfully kitschy ice cream brand founded by (and named after) two Vermont hippies, is best known for its creative flavors and slumber-party-perfect pint containers. While neither of those characteristics necessarily point to Ben & Jerry\u2019s potential as a healthy treat, Barbara Kovalenko, a nutrition consultant at Lasta, assured us that the brand\u2019s ice cream can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a nutritious diet, largely because of its careful sourcing and focus on natural ingredients.\n\u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s provides organic and fair trade options,\u201d Kovalenko said. To balance out the high calorie content, Kovalenko suggested that you \u201cadhere to suggested serving sizes and treat yourself to it sometimes rather than making it a regular component of your diet.\u201d\nDr. Ellen Albertson, a registered dietician and psychologist and creator of The Midlife Whisperer, also pointed out that the higher fat content of Ben & Jerry\u2019s can make it easier to stick with smaller portions:\n\u201cThe brand uses natural ingredients, no artificial fats, and non-GMO milk from cows that graze,\u201d Albertson said. \u201cPlus, each scoop is packed with flavor, so a small serving is very satisfying.\u201d\nA 2/3-cup serving of Ben & Jerry\u2019s vanilla ice cream contains 330 calories, 28 total grams of sugar, 21 total grams of fat and 6 grams of protein. Each container includes 3 servings.\nYasso Ice Cream Bars\nGreek yogurt tends to be a popular choice among dairy fans who want to take a healthier approach, thanks to its dense texture, its slightly tangy flavor and its higher protein content. Yasso Greek Yogurt Bars echo more typical ice cream bars with their luxe, tongue-coating creaminess.\nMolly Pelletier, a registered dietician who specializes in gut health, recommends them to anyone in search of a healthy ice cream option. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of Yasso Ice cream bars. Yasso bars are not only low in sugar, but also a good source of protein,\u201d she said.\nA single serving of chocolate fudge flavored Yasso contains 80 calories, 12 total grams of sugar, 0 total grams of fat and 6 grams of protein.\nYasso also makes bite-sized Poppables, which Beckerman views as an ideal grab-and-go frozen snack. \u201cYasso Poppables are the healthiest on the market, thanks to the portion-controlled, probiotic-forward, poppablility of Greek yogurt coated in a dark chocolatey quinoa crunch,\u201d she said",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-compost-at-home_l_645a4d4be4b0c10612e73fdc": "Composting has been around since the beginning of time, but the climate crisis has driven up interest in turning waste into fertilizer in recent decades. While some people do their own composting, others take advantage of weekly compost pickups provided by their cities or towns, or visit bins at their local farmers market to drop off their compostable waste.\nComposting reduces waste and lowers greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50%, making it an important action step in the fight against climate change. Unfortunately, composting can be incredibly confusing for beginners. What can you compost, and what can\u2019t you compost? Does \u201cbiodegradable\u201d mean compostable? What kind of bin do you need? If you\u2019re not doing it right, you could be wasting a lot of time and energy without even making a positive impact.\nHere are the most common mistakes sustainability experts see composting novices making.\nGiving Up Too Quickly\nMark Driscoll, a sustainability expert and founder of the sustainable food systems consultancy Tasting the Future, is the first to admit that composting is an art, especially if you\u2019re composting in your own backyard or even saving up compost throughout the week. \u201cPeople give up too early when things go wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, people often fail to get the right mix of green and brown material within their compost bins/heap. Unless your grass clippings are mixed with brown material, it will turn into sticky, smelly sludge.\u201d\nHe explained that \u201cgreens\u201d are things like grass clippings, uncooked kitchen waste, fruit and vegetable peelings and leafy plants. \u201cBrowns,\u201d on the other hand, include items like hedge clippings, wood chips, leaves, plant stems, paper (including shredded paper), cards and paper straws, wooden egg boxes and paper-based tea bags.\nAbby K. Cannon, a registered dietitian who lives an eco-friendly lifestyle, admitted that there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to composting. \u201cBut once you get the hang of composting, which doesn\u2019t take very long to do, it becomes second nature and you\u2019ll wonder why you didn\u2019t start sooner,\u201d she said.\nNot Knowing What You Can Compost\nMost people know you can compost fruits and vegetables. But according to Cannon, there are plenty of other little-known waste items that should go in the compost bin, not the trash. \u201cYou can actually compost your own hair and nail clippings,\u201d she said. Gross? Yes. Great information? Also yes.\nDriscoll added that you can compost pet hair, among other surprising items: \u201cYou can compost coffee grounds and tea bags (be careful, though, as some tea bags are made from plastic and should be avoided), natural loofahs, cotton balls and cotton T-shirts that are made from 100% cotton without added synthetics, old wool clothing (preferably with natural dyes) with any zips, buttons or fasteners removed, the inner tube of toilet rolls and small amounts of shredded cardboard\u201d with any tape removed.\nAnd perhaps most surprising, Driscoll said you can actually compost human urine. \u201cFor men, peeing on your compost can add high levels of nitrogen or phosphorus, although you\u2019ll need a secluded garden for this.\u201d\nNot Knowing What You Can\u2019t Compost\nJust as important as understanding what you can compost is understanding what you can\u2019t compost. Both Driscoll and Cannon note that you cannot compost meat, as this will create a smelly compost pile and probably attract vermin, and, although eggshells are fine to compost, eggs are not.\nDriscoll said many people take the \u201cbiodegradable\u201d label on plastic bags to mean \u201ccompostable.\u201d \u201cJust because they are biodegradable does not mean they are compostable,\u201d he said. \u201cBiodegradable plastics can leave a toxic residue, while compostable plastics break down into water, carbon and biomass that can produce nutrients for plants.\u201d\nIn a similar vein, Cannon said that if you have a backyard compost, you may not be able to compost packaging that says \u201ccompostable\u201d on it. \u201cYou have to make sure that it\u2019s backyard compostable, not commercially compostable,\u201d she said. \u201cIf something is labeled commercially compostable, it\u2019s not suitable for your backyard compost, unfortunately.\u201d\nNot Turning Your Compost Regularly Enough\nWhether you\u2019re composting in your own backyard or saving up compost in a bin throughout the week, it\u2019s important to turn your compost every three to four days. But many people forget to do this. \u201cI\u2019m totally guilty of this myself,\u201d Cannon admitted.\nDriscoll explained that turning your compost regularly actually speeds up the composting process, which is especially convenient when you\u2019re building your own backyard compost. \u201cYou can either use a rotating compost bin or turn it by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cTurning adds air that speeds up the composting process.\u201d\nUsing Compost As Your Main Source Of Discarding Food Waste\nWhile composting is an excellent way to reduce food waste and lower greenhouse gas emissions, if you find your compost pile getting unwieldy, it\u2019s worth it to consider other ways to reduce food waste. \u201cVegetable scraps can be used to make broth, nut milk can be made from leftover nut pulp and stale bread can be transformed into croutons or breadcrumbs,\u201d plant-based chef Matthew Kenney said. \u201cBy getting creative and using all parts of our food, we can reduce our environmental impact and enjoy delicious meals at the same time.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no doubt that composting requires some patience, but as with anything, it will become easier the more you do it. And sustainability experts will be the first to tell you the environmental payoff is well worth it.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stress-eating-unhealthy-foods_l_5f8efa7dc5b69daf5e16db1e": "From COVID-19 to a stressful news cycle, there\u2019s no shortage of things stressing us out. And unfortunately, when the going gets tough, the tough get hungry. Tension triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can signal hunger cravings and send us on a search for food (especially the junk variety) to soothe our uneasy souls.\nUsing food as a coping mechanism for stressful situations \u2015 think emotional eating \u2015 can cause more harm than good. But on the other hand, food doesn\u2019t have to be the enemy. In fact, when you make mindful choices, food can be a useful tool for taking the edge off. It all boils down to selectivity.\nChoosing wisely between what will help alleviate overall stress in the long run versus the instant gratification given by unhealthy fixes is how the war on stress can be fought (and won) with food.\nFood and stress are connected and should be managed concurrently\nThe brain and the gut literally feed off each other, so the idea that what we eat triggers and affects our emotions is by no means far-fetched.\n\u201cThe gut is our second brain,\u201d explains Nikki Ostrower, an integrative nutritionist and founder of NAO Wellness. \u201cSome of the brain\u2019s neurotransmitters, aka happy chemicals, are manufactured in the gut \u2015 90% of serotonin, for example [a neurotransmitter associated with mood, sleep, appetite and gastrointestinal activity] is produced in the gut, which means there\u2019s a direct correlation between mental health, well-being, digestion and food cravings.\u201d\nWhat drives people in the direction of comfort food is those aforementioned cravings, plus a lack of healthy options at hand. \u201cPeople turn to food when they\u2019re stressed because it provides easy albeit temporary relief,\u201d Ostrower said. Unfortunately, the quick and easy fixes often don\u2019t offer any health benefits.\nComfort in the moment can be consequential in the future\nOften, what we eat for contentment increases physical and mental stress. Those sluggish, tired or foggy feelings that follow an overindulgent meal are no accident, and the side effects are far from comforting.\nJudith Joseph, a psychiatrist and professor at New York University, has noticed an uptick in patients \u201ccooking more decadent foods that remind them of happier times\u201d during the pandemic. She warns, however, that \u201ctypical comfort foods like fried and sugary dishes boost a chemical in our brain called dopamine, so initially it feels really good eating these things.\u201d But those good feelings are short-lived, Joseph reminds us, because \u201cthese foods can cause unhealthy spikes in insulin and lead to a buildup of unhealthy cholesterol in your organs, which puts stress on the body and brain.\u201d\n\u201cWe reach for the usual comfort food suspects because they initially help us feel better, but they all cause stress in the body\u2019s organs and ultimately end up making things worse,\u201d Joseph said. In order to tap into food\u2019s ability to control angst, Joseph advises choosing healthy foods \u201cas an important component of self-care that can lead to decreased anxiety.\u201d\nWhat to eat when you\u2019re stressed\nThe urge to stress eat makes it tough to make mindful choices, but fighting that urge can prove beneficial to keeping your emotions in check. Rheumatologist Magdalena Cadet recommends eating any foods rich in zinc (which lowers cortisol levels), magnesium (which encourages relaxation and sleep) and vitamin E (which reduces oxidative stress on the brain) to help with stress reduction. \u201cSunflower seeds and legumes like chickpeas are great starting points,\u201d she suggested.\nOstrower, who documented her personal battle with pandemic-induced stress eating on social media, attests, \u201cA diet rich in natural whole foods and absent of the packaged processed stuff, can be a strong ally in fending off stress. After one day of mindful and conscious food choices, feelings of clarity and strength slowly returned.\u201d\nFoods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, tuna and walnuts have been known to help with combating stress since, according to Cadet, they can \u201creduce inflammation in the body and help prevent spikes in blood pressure.\u201d Based on their similar stress-busting capabilities, Cadet suggests \u201copting for flaxseed, soybean or canola oil when cooking\u201d and is also a fan of sweet potatoes and other nutrient-rich complex carbohydrates \u201cfor their ability to lower cortisol levels and provide adequate vitamin C and potassium, which are important stress fighters.\u201d\nChocolate devotees have options as well, according to Ostrower, who \u201calways suggests dark chocolate for clients craving something decadent because it\u2019s filled with essential calming minerals like magnesium.\u201d Citrus fruits, chamomile and turmeric are also high on Ostrower\u2019s list because they \u201csupport healthy gut function and have mood-boosting qualities.\u201d\nChoose healthy foods with similar qualities to your favorite snacks\nSwitching from potato chips to an apple feels like a downgrade, right? To combat that, Joseph recommends searching for reasonable facsimiles.\n\u201cInstead of seeking the crunchy sensation from chips, try crunchy almonds; instead of sipping two glasses of wine, sip one glass of wine and one cup of chamomile tea, which has natural relaxants,\u201d she suggests. \u201cInstead of overdosing on coffee, replace a cup of joe with a cup of matcha, which contains antioxidants and boosts attention without the high buzz or anxiety.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-athletes-eat-for-breakfast_l_61fd5250e4b09170e9d0482e": "The Winter Olympics are here, and as we watch super humans (aka professional athletes) perform impressive physical feats, you may wonder what exactly they eat to be able to do these incredible things. To get answers, we chatted with two experts who have spent years working with professional athletes to figure out the best foods to fuel their grueling workouts and perform at their peak on game day.\nSo, what do professional athletes eat for breakfast?\nThe short answer: It depends. Brittany Dunn, a performance dietitian and chef for the Philadelphia Eagles, has found that what professional athletes eat varies widely among athletes and the sports they play.\n\u201cI have worked with an athlete who prefers two boiled eggs with peanut butter toast and a coffee, an athlete who prefers an acai bowl and sauteed veggies, and an athlete who orders two breakfast sandwiches and tater tots,\u201d she told HuffPost.\nAs far as macronutrients and micronutrients go, Dunn notes that all of these breakfasts deliver nutritional benefits to each athlete. \u201cThe contrasting characteristics of athlete breakfasts are heavily influenced by personal preferences and diets, the amount of time between eating and the following training session, body composition and sport,\u201d she said.\nCome game day, race day or competition day, athletes don\u2019t take any chances with their breakfast. Consistency is the name of the game, and the last thing a professional athlete needs is an upset stomach. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that many athletes have an established game day meal plan,\u201d Dunn said. In her experience, most athletes eat the same breakfast before every competition. \u201cGame day is not the day to try new foods,\u201d she said. Additionally, having a consistent breakfast routine can help professional athletes feel more mentally prepared for the day ahead.\nAs for general caloric needs, professional athletes need to consume more than the average person given the amount of energy they\u2019re using in their respective sports, and to help with recovery. Dunn said that while she hasn\u2019t directly worked with an athlete with a diet quite as astonishing as Michael Phelps\u2019 (who is rumored to have consumed 12,000 calories a day when training), she has worked with an athlete who required a 1,000-calorie recovery smoothie post-training, plus three to four additional meals throughout the day. \u201cThe goal here was for the athlete to maintain body composition and provide fuel to support training and energy needs,\u201d she said.\nHow do the diets of professional athletes compare to that of an everyday person?\nGiven the higher caloric needs of professional athletes, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to consume five, six or even eight meals a day, with a mix of full meals, shakes and snacks. Since they need to consume so many calories (particularly carbs), professional athletes get a bit of a pass as far as simple sugars go, as they\u2019re easier to digest.\n\u201cWe really need to put a lot of fuel into athletes, so we might give them things like juice or even candy to make them feel more hungry,\u201d Dr. Marc Bubbs, a performance nutritionist with a portfolio of professional and Olympic athletes and the author of \u201cPeak 40,\u201d told HuffPost. \u201cFor the general population, we don\u2019t want them eating these foods that make them hungry more often or that have a lot of energy density to them.\u201d\nBubbs explained that the more intense your exercise, the greater your reliance on carbohydrates, so professional athletes simply need more carbohydrates in their system. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a fire: If you have a really hot fire, you can put all sorts of logs on there and the fire is still going to burn really well and stay hot, kind of like the metabolism and the exercise and activity of athletes,\u201d he said. But put too many logs on the fire and the fire goes out, similar to when an average person consumes more calories than they need, which eventually leads to weight gain, high blood sugar and inflammation. The male athletes he\u2019s worked with need about 4,000 calories a day while the general recommendation for the average person is around 2,000 calories per day.\n\u201cThe total calories depend on the energy demands of the sport,\u201d Bubbs said. \u201cA cyclist or swimmer may need 6,000 to 8,000 calories per day (due to the high volume of training), while team sport athletes like basketball and soccer will land between 3,500 and 5,000 calories (which will vary depending on the demands of the day).\u201d He added that since women are, in general, smaller and lighter, they would most likely (but not always) require fewer calories.\nWhile the average person might make a smoothie for breakfast with water, protein powder and berries, a professional athlete might substitute fruit juice for the water and add mangoes, pineapples and bananas to up the carb content. Another example Bubbs gave was a bowl of plain yogurt with berries and nuts, which makes for a solid breakfast for the average person (not too many carbs or fats, and plenty of protein). To up the carb content, a professional athlete might add sliced banana, muesli and maple syrup. The key concept here, Bubbs explained, is carbohydrate periodization: fueling for the demands of an athlete each day, whether that\u2019s competition, practice or even rest.\nIn crafting meal plans for her clients, Dunn\u2019s primary goal is to ensure that she\u2019s providing proper calories and appropriate nutrients specific to the athlete\u2019s needs and sport. In doing this, she takes into consideration which foods fit into any dietary restrictions and preferences the athletes have. It\u2019s important that the athletes actually like what they\u2019re eating so that they finish their meals and get the fuel they need to perform.\nThe breakfasts of professional athletes are, by necessity, more consistent than those of an average person as far as consumption, timing and nutritional content go. Skipping breakfast is a fairly inconsequential choice for the average person headed to their desk job, but for an athlete headed to an intense workout that lasts several hours, skipping breakfast can lead to disastrous results. \u201cOne of the biggest differences is that my work with professional athletes can be a lot more meticulous, as I am typically more involved with them on a daily basis, with access to the frequent labs and body composition analysis, to make necessary adjustments along the way,\u201d Dunn said.\nExpert-approved breakfast recommendations for active people\nFor the active person who isn\u2019t a professional athlete, there are some general guidelines to follow to help fuel your workouts and help achieve your health and fitness goals. Dunn recommends ensuring that your breakfast includes healthy fats, protein and complex, fiber-filled carbohydrates. \u201cThese nutrients not only support muscle, combat inflammation and aid in vitamins and mineral absorption, but they also help maintain a feeling of satiety until the next mealtime.\u201d\nSome specific breakfast options she recommends are yogurt with granola and berries, whole-grain cereal with fruit toppings and milk or a protein-packed milk substitute, oatmeal with nut butter and fruit, cottage cheese and whole-grain toast, a veggie omelet with toast, and a waffle with nut butter and milk.\nBubbs recommends starting with protein when building your meal, with at least 20 grams of protein for active individuals. \u201cBreakfast is the meal of the day that people typically get the least amount of protein, so that should be the main focus,\u201d he said. He said 30 to 40 grams of protein per meal for men and 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal for women are ideal amounts to hit. This number will vary for individuals based on their activity level and body weight. For reference, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for active individuals.\nNext up is carbohydrates, which Bubbs recommends decreasing for individuals looking to lose weight or improve their blood sugar. \u201cHave more berries rather than bananas, and have a slice of bread rather than three or four,\u201d he said. Last is fats. Again, if you\u2019re trying to lose weight, this is an area you can be conservative with: a drizzle of olive oil or a quarter or half of an avocado.\nIf you\u2019re the type of person to get a morning workout in, Bubbs\u2019 recommendation differs depending on the type of workout you\u2019re doing. For an aerobic workout, he recommends fasting or having a low-carb breakfast, but for an intense training session he recommends eating a full breakfast beforehand with sufficient carbohydrates. \u201cIf you\u2019re training hard, make sure you have enough fuel on board,\u201d he said.",

But this was not an attempt at reverse psychology. It was an invitation to experience ice cream for what it is \u2014 to explore the pros and cons of a sizable nightly dose of sugar and cream.\nA health coach is not a therapist, and a well-trained one offers concrete guidance only when asked, in response to a client\u2019s needs. This particular client was already eating a pint of ice cream most nights. She loved the nightly indulgence but hated the long-term impact on her health. She felt stuck and was pushing for solutions.\nAs a Mayo Clinic- and National Board-certified health coach, I work with people who are stuck in habits they\u2019d rather lose and are interested in building new ones.\n\u201cThe whole pint, every night, until we meet again,\u201d I said. \u201cTake note of the effects in the moment and after. If you do that, we can get a clear, guilt-free assessment of how it feels.\u201d\nMy client was embroiled in a classic struggle: Wake up with all the \u201cbest\u201d intentions and set a bunch of rules for how to get through the day and night. Decide in advance how much to eat (and when) and what calisthenics to perform. Grow frustrated as the day wears on, abandon the goals in exchange for promises of tomorrow, heavily indulge in anticipation of upcoming deprivation, and sleep fitfully before doing it all again the next day.\nTo be clear, this was not an eating disorder by her own or any doctor\u2019s assessment. Unlike binge eating disorder \u2014 which is a clinical diagnosis characterized by shame, hiding food, eating excessive amounts in short periods of time, and withdrawing from friends and meaningful activities to allow for binging \u2014 this was a rut, paved with rocky road. (If you are struggling with symptoms of BED or any other eating disorder, you can find help through the National Eating Disorders Association.)\nMy client wanted an escape hatch from the nauseating carnival ride of diet culture. She wanted to be healthy, functional and confident in her body. She also hoped ice cream could continue to be part of her life.\n\u201cMy client wanted an escape hatch from the nauseating carnival ride of diet culture.\u201d\nThe traditional way to \u201cget healthy\u201d in the United States over the last century has been to exert control \u2014 to set and comply with rules that are purported to help achieve this elusive goal. The problem with that is two-fold: (1) life is stressful and triggering, and (2) most people don\u2019t like being controlled, even by their own rules. They want autonomy, to make their own decisions on their own time and to deal with stress however they see fit.\nA \u201cbad\u201d habit is just a coping mechanism. And for those of us lucky enough to have stable jobs in relatively peaceful, developed countries, food is one of the most reliable \u201cquick fixes\u201d there is. It delivers an accessible, easy hit of pleasure \u2014 consequences be damned.\nTrying to banish soothing balms in a blaze of chronic stress is a recipe for frustration and failure, even if those balms don\u2019t feel so good in the long run.\nWe\u2019ve been told: Stop eating late at night. Cut out all your favorite foods. You\u2019re lazy if you don\u2019t work out, and God forbid you simply don\u2019t like to cook. You need to control yourself! Send in the self-care apps, trackers, diets and fitness plans that will transform you into a \u201cbetter\u201d person.\nIf I could fossilize any word on the self-help landscape and shatter it with the power of Medusa\u2019s snakes hissing wildly atop my head, it would be the word CONTROL. \u201cSelf-care\u201d that feels more like prison than a step toward freedom is bound to send you ricocheting blindly back to your old \u201cbad\u201d habits.\nWe don\u2019t need control. We need relief. How we find it is as unique as we are.\nWhen I started out as a personal trainer many years ago, I was broken-hearted over an ex-boyfriend. I worked out aggressively every day to render my heart shatterproof. I dragged myself out of bed and raged at the gym for an hour each morning before plunking down behind a desk at my temp job.\nPounding his memory out of my body felt like a relief, but, as time passed, the routine began to feel like a trap. He owned my mornings, even after he was gone. The habit served its purpose at first, but, eventually, I was faced with a choice: stick with a tired routine, give up and feel like a failure, or honor the situation for what it was and move on to something new.\nI chose the latter and went hiking instead.\nThrough all of this, I was stuffing myself at night: bowls of homemade cookie dough and large pizzas for one. The food felt like a different kind of relief, and I discovered that no good ever came of trying to \u201ccontrol\u201d myself. It sent me into a deprivation mindset where I generally ended up swinging from the ceiling fan with a box of Krispy Kreme howling, \u201cOh yeah? How do you like this, Buzzkill?\u201d\nAgain, I was faced with a choice: I could keep eating reactively and hating myself for it, keep stuffing myself and enjoy the comfort, or start exploring alternative ways to get that nightly relief.\nI couldn\u2019t decide. I knew I didn\u2019t want to hate myself, but the other two choices left me stumped. Was the food making me feel good enough to justify the pain of acid reflux and bloating? It was a definite maybe. I really did love the high of a sheet cake and a fork (and still do). But what if there were other ways to feel just as good at night, if not better?\nI needed to investigate, and in order to investigate, I needed to eat \u2014 on purpose, judgment-free, with curiosity \u2014 to root into the old habits for a while (and play around with new ones) to figure out what \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d actually felt like. I was eating that way anyway, so I might as well find out precisely how a bowl of cookie dough and a large pizza felt in my body.\nTurns out, it felt uncomfortable to be so full at night. It messed with my sleep. It didn\u2019t feel great to abuse myself at the gym in the name of an absent ex-boyfriend, either. These truths are now self-evident.\nMeanwhile, my clients faced all kinds of health challenges. I had folks with kids and folks with none. I had attorneys, gardeners and designers, and they all wanted to know the same thing: How can I change my bad habits, and why is changing so hard? They wanted me to provide the answers, but I was a 26-year-old personal trainer with a volatile relationship with food. I didn\u2019t have answers yet, but I was hellbent on finding them.\nOver the following 20 years of health coaching and personal training, what I found is that prescribed diet and fitness plans breed rebellion in most people, but it\u2019s often a quiet rebellion. If I created a plan for them, they didn\u2019t tell me not to bother. They took it home and printed it out. They dutifully stuck it on the fridge or the bathroom mirror. They blamed themselves for not following through, but \u2014 at the end of a long day \u2014 my well-intended directions didn\u2019t hold any relevance for them. Relief did.\nPeople tell me about the things they\u2019re doing \u201cwrong\u201d all the time. They imagine taking command of their bodies and impulses is the only way to change, but when I ask what they\u2019re looking to achieve, the answer is usually about freedom \u2014 freedom from dieting, from procrastination, low body image, discomfort, or physical aches and pains.\nIn my professional experience, control doesn\u2019t lead to freedom.\nRules can certainly offer relief, but only if they\u2019re established to fill a need. They can serve as a kind of scaffolding to feed cravings for new healthy habits, but the decision to follow any rule has to be made again and again, day after day. If it feels like a chore, what are your odds of following through? Rules are infinitely easier to follow when they serve up a hit of pleasure or relief.\nDestructive habits aren\u2019t personal failures. They make evolutionary sense. People return to activities that have eased stress or suffering in the past. Research on behavior change is complex, but, to start, it shows the most effective way to change is to:\ngather evidence about what matters to you and why (in other words, identify what fuels your motivation) and\ncreate conditions for easy access to the new choice.\nWe need visceral, dependable, unbiased data to determine which routines enrich our quality of life \u2014 and which ones detract from it \u2014 and convenient, alluring alternatives. The most trustworthy place to find that data is in the habits themselves. They have a lot to teach us, but we can\u2019t receive the messages while silencing them and demonizing ourselves.\n\u201cIf it feels like a chore, what are your odds of following through? Rules are infinitely easier to follow when they serve up a hit of pleasure or relief.\u201d\nWhen my client came back a week after receiving her ice cream assignment, she was full of apologies. She had failed to complete the mission. Knowing another pint of ice cream was coming the next night, she found herself satisfied with a half or third of a pint. She let her body do the talking and discovered she did, in fact, like ice cream, but not as fanatically as she thought. When she figured that out, the battle fizzled \u2014 the one over ice cream, anyway. She had robbed it of its fuel.\nMost folks I work with want to maintain flexibility or pleasure in their lives, so we start by identifying what pleasure actually means for them. In the case of this client, a whole pint wasn\u2019t it.\nShe set aside \u201ccontrol\u201d and put herself in a position of power to choose \u2014 \u201cgood\u201d things, \u201cbad\u201d things, or whatever things made her feel well. She didn\u2019t have to comply with declarations she made the day before or pretend she knew in advance what choice she would make tomorrow. Without the threat of deprivation, the impulse to overindulge withered.\nBad habits can be good fun, until the repercussions add up to something worth changing. When that happens to me, I head straight back into the bad habit until the desire for something new is indisputable. From there, I go looking for relief and invariably find it in something a little kinder for my body.\nIt\u2019s a scavenger hunt for satisfaction, and relief is just around the bend at the intersection of wellness and pleasure.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237.\nSarah Hays Coomer is a Mayo Clinic and National Board Certified Health and Wellness Coach and author.

    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/full-fat-yogurt-better-than-low-fat_l_60bf952ee4b0427b3fdc15b9": "Have you ever eaten plain yogurt and thought that it tastes like sadness? That\u2019s probably because it was of the low-fat variety \u2015 or worse, nonfat. The fact of the matter is, plain yogurt made with whole milk tastes better. It has a richer mouthfeel and a creamier body that\u2019s so much more enjoyable to spoon up.\nNot only that, it has nutritional advantages over low-fat yogurt.\nWhen it comes to plain (unflavored) yogurt, it\u2019s important to know the main variations:\nAmerican-style plain whole-milk yogurt, made by brands like Stonyfield, which is about 120 calories and 6 grams of protein per 3/4 cup.\nWhole-milk Greek yogurt, also known as strained yogurt, made by brands like Fage and Chobani, which is typically 160 calories per 3/4 cup with a protein boost of 15 grams.\nThere\u2019s also skyr, which is really more like a milk cheese, but eaten the same way as yogurt. It\u2019s high in protein and low in sugar, but tends to have a smoother flavor than its yogurt cousins. You\u2019ll find about 170 calories and 18 grams of protein in a 2/3-cup serving of whole milk skyr from Siggi\u2019s.\nThe experts interviewed for this article told HuffPost they typically prefer the Greek and skyr variations of yogurt because they\u2019re higher in protein. Here\u2019s why you should eat full-fat yogurt, according to the experts.\n1. Full-fat yogurt tends to have less sugar\nFat wasn\u2019t the enemy of American diets until about 1977. Around then, the government started pushing low-fat diets, which resulted in the mass manufacturing of low-fat products in the 1980s. The reason for this anti-fat craze was the belief that saturated fats were directly linked to heart disease. But newer research has shown that isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\n\u201cPeople often fear full-fat yogurt for its saturated fat content and risk for raising LDL cholesterol levels,\u201d explained Rahaf Al Bochi, registered dietitian and owner of Olive Tree Nutrition. \u201cHowever, research in this area is inconclusive and is evolving, with a body of evidence suggesting a protective effect of full-fat dairy on cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk.\u201d\nSometimes, lower fat yogurts are higher in sugar to accommodate the low-fat taste, which leaves people feeling unsatisfied (and might result in them adding even more sugar), Al Bochi explained.\n2. Full-fat yogurt is less likely to spike your blood sugar\nWhen you eat plain full-fat yogurt instead of varieties that contain more sugar, like fruit-flavored ones, you\u2019re less likely to experience a spike in blood sugar. \u201cIf you\u2019re having flavored yogurt, it might spike your blood sugar more, which leads to more of a crash later on,\u201d said Lauren Sharpe, a Philadelphia-based registered dietitian. Chobani\u2019s raspberry yogurt, for example, has 9 grams of added sugar (a total of 13), compared with about 4 total grams of sugar in the company\u2019s full-fat plain yogurt.\nWhen you crash after a blood sugar spike, you\u2019re more likely to have cravings that make you want to grab the closest snacks. Instead of eating flavored yogurt, consider adding a drizzle of honey or some fresh fruit to plain yogurt.\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, that even plain full-fat yogurt contains sugar. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to get about 12 grams of naturally occurring lactose from one cup of milk, no matter what, whether that\u2019s a cup of dairy, cup of yogurt, a cup of milk,\u201d said Jaclyn London, head of nutrition and wellness of WW. You might not get fewer total grams of sugar, but you will get a lower percentage, which will help you feel full because it takes longer for your body to digest, absorb, and metabolize the sugar that you\u2019re getting from dairy, said London.\n3. Full-fat yogurt will curb your appetite for longer\nAnother benefit of eating yogurt made with whole milk is that you\u2019re more likely to feel full for longer than if you eat low-fat or nonfat yogurt. \u201cA cup of plain Greek yogurt can give you up to 20 grams of protein per that 6-to 7-ounce serving. So you\u2019re really going to get a lot of that filling benefit from the protein itself, not necessarily just from the fact that the combo of those two (fat and protein) together can help you feel fuller longer,\u201d London said.\nYou\u2019ll also feel more satisfied. Sharpe explained that anything can fill you up \u2014 for example, a bowl of spinach \u2014 but for something to have staying power it needs to be more nutritionally complete. \u201cWhen we have the full-fat yogurt, there\u2019s definitely more of that satisfaction factor, so that you\u2019re not continuing to think about food all the time because you just feel obviously full from the fat and the protein that\u2019s in the yogurt, but also you feel satisfied,\u201d Sharpe said.\n4. It tastes better, and that matters!\nAs one researcher at Stanford University found, it may be easier to make nutritious food choices when you eat what tastes delicious. \u201cFull-fat yogurt is rich, tasty, versatile and nutritious,\u201d said Al Bochi.\nNutritionally, yogurt made with whole milk isn\u2019t much different from plain low-fat or nonfat yogurt. They have about the same amount of protein and have probiotics. But the fat content in the whole-milk yogurt makes the eating experience go from droopy to wow, which may make you less likely to reach for the junk food later.\nFull-fat yogurt is also a great ingredient to use in recipes when you want added creaminess with a boost of protein. Use it in place of milk when you\u2019re making macaroni and cheese (especially if you make boxed mac), or use it as a substitute for sour cream.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-cast-iron-skillet_l_6400bcd7e4b0bdb99f4a8c97": "The cast iron skillet enjoys a well-earned reputation as a kitchen workhorse. This tool is both reasonably priced and shockingly durable, as proven by the fact that cast iron skillets are regularly passed down through generations of home cooks. Another point in favor of the cast iron skillet comes in the form of its versatility: \u201cWith a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, you can cook nearly everything,\u201d said Tiffany Swan, a trained chef, food scientist and recipe developer behind Salt + Sage.\nBut that \u201cnearly\u201d is doing some heavy lifting, because there are, without question, dishes that aren\u2019t well-suited to this particular type of pan. We asked a group of professional chefs and food scientists to share the foods that they\u2019d never cook in cast iron, and they provided this list of eight dishes to avoid.\nTomato Sauce\nOur consulted chefs largely agreed that acidic foods don\u2019t interact positively with unenameled cast iron, and they cited tomato sauce \u2015 like marinara sauce, Bolognese sauce or shakshuka sauce \u2015 as a prime example of an acidic dish that can wear down cast iron. Bryan Quoc Le, a food scientist and author, explained that \u201cthe acidity found in tomatoes is high enough to extract the iron from the cast iron.\u201d Tomatoes naturally include a high amount of citric acid (up to 9% of their body weight, according to Le), and \u201csince the cast iron is bare and not alloyed with chromium, the surface will continue to oxidize and be stripped of the surface iron in the presence of tomato-based dishes,\u201d he said.\nThe risk of iron particles leeching into your sauce is really only relevant if you\u2019re making \u201ca long-simmered tomato sauce,\u201d as brief contact with tomatoes won\u2019t release enough acid to affect the pan\u2019s surface, Swan noted. Also, the damage caused by the iron particles in the sauce is primarily flavor-related \u2015 the leeching \u201cis minimal enough that you don\u2019t need to worry about iron poisoning or ruining the seasoning of the pan,\u201d she said.\nDishes With Wine-Based Sauces, Like Chicken Piccata Or Coq Au Vin\nAnother example of an acidic dish that can react to cast iron, chicken piccata (breaded chicken cooked in lemon sauce) thrives in a pan with an enameled surface that won\u2019t have an impact on its finished flavor. The lemon itself can leech iron from the pan (much as tomato acid can). And another problem arises when you deglaze the pan with white wine, as many chicken piccata recipes require.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re making chicken piccata and [plan to] make the sauce by deglazing the pan with wine, I would not recommend using cast iron,\u201d suggested Jeff Carter, the executive chef of Dancing Bear Appalachian Bistro in Townsend, Tennessee. \u201cThe cast iron will release flavors or seasonings into your white wine deglazing sauce and give it an off-putting flavor. If you must deglaze a cast iron pan, use stock or water \u2015 never use acidic liquids like wine or vinegar.\u201d\nThe same goes for coq au vin. Deglazing a cast iron pan with wine isn\u2019t a great move, so it stands to reason that any \u201cwine-heavy stews, sauces or braises\u201d also don\u2019t thrive in cast iron, said professionally-trained chef and culinary educator Micole Rondinone. A dish like coq au vin, which involves chicken slow-braised in wine with mushrooms, pork lardons and vegetables, could be a victim of the wine\u2019s acidity pulling iron flavor from the skillet. Stick with an enameled Dutch oven or a deep enameled skillet for wine braises.\nAdobo\nAccording to chef Kevin Truong of Fil N\u2019 Viet in Austin, Texas, adobo, \u201ca popular Filipino dish where meat or seafood is marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and other spices,\u201d shouldn\u2019t be prepared in a cast iron skillet, mainly because of the vinegar. \u201cThe high acidity of adobo from the vinegar will impart a metallic flavor in the dish,\u201d Truong said. Because the vinegar\u2019s acidity is so high, cooking a vinegar-based sauce in cast iron \u201ccould also mean you would have to re-season your cast iron skillet,\u201d he added.\nBrothy Beans\nBoiling and simmering broth, water or other liquids in a seasoned cast iron skillet \u201cwill strip the pan of that nice patina and loosen the beautiful seasoning that you have achieved,\u201d said Gee Cuyugan, executive chef of Mercat a la Planxa in Chicago. If you\u2019d like to skip the long process of re-seasoning your skillet, cook your brothy recipes in enameled or stainless steel pots.\nCaramel\nIf you\u2019re making your own caramel sauce, keep in mind that caramel can easily absorb flavors \u2015 and because most cast iron users don\u2019t thoroughly scrub their pans with soap after each use (as rigorous cleaning can remove the pan\u2019s seasoning), cast iron skillets are a poor choice for caramel-making.\n\u201cCaramel sauce will pull in the flavor or seasoning from your cast iron, making your dessert taste like the dishes made in your cast iron in the past,\u201d Carter warned.\nFlaky Fish\nCompared to nonstick pans and other lighter-weight cookware items, cast iron doesn\u2019t conduct heat with great efficiency. That\u2019s why Los Angeles-based chef Kai Chase chooses to avoid cast iron when cooking delicate, flaky fish like cod, sea bass, flounder and salmon.\n\u201cFlaky fish, such as salmon or flounder, are too delicate to cook in the cast iron skillet because it\u2019s a poor conductor of heat, unlike its nonstick counterpart,\u201d she said. \u201cTo cook a salmon filet, you need a pan that provides high heat transfer so the fish doesn\u2019t stick and break apart when you try to flip it \u2015 a cast iron skillet can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nCrepes\n\u201cFor crepes, you need to be able to quickly and easily tilt the pan to be sure the batter/egg covers the pan\u2019s surface easily. That\u2019s really hard to do with a heavy cast iron skillet,\u201d explained Lisa Steele, author of the Fresh Eggs Daily Cookbook. \u201cThey\u2019re too heavy for me (and I would guess most people!) to lift with one hand and tilt to flip the food. Cast iron is nice to cook in generally because it retains heat so well, but this can also lead to overcooking or over-browning on crepes since they\u2019re so thin.\u201d\nOmelets\nOn the topic of delicate dishes, \u201cegg-based items like fried eggs and omelets are often difficult to cook correctly in cast iron,\u201d said chef/instructor Stephen Chavez of the Institute of Culinary Education.\nSteele agreed that omelets don\u2019t make sense in cast iron. \u201cEggs in general tend to stick in cast iron, no matter how much butter or oil you use,\u201d she explained. \u201cA good steel pan or an enameled skillet are both far better choices for omelets. You also want a very shallow pan with sloped sides so you can slide your spatula under to flip and/or fold the sides. But mostly, lifting the pan over and over to [flip an omelet] would be very tiring with a heavy cast iron pan.\u201d\nNeed a new cast iron skillet?

These were their picks.\nThis yogurt is low in saturated fat, contains no added sugar and is an excellent source of protein, according to Mary Wirtz, a registered dietitian and consultant for Mom Loves Best. She recommends the 0% fat option. \u201cIt\u2019s also organic and non-GMO project verified,\u201d she said. \u201cTopping this Greek yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey, berries and slivered almonds is a fantastic protein-rich breakfast to include regularly.\u201d\n\u201cThis yogurt is very high in saturated fat and also contains 23g of sugar (15g of added sugars) per 1 cup serving,\u201d Wirtz said. \u201cUnfortunately, that is more sugar than five Oreo cookies.\u201d\nThis yogurt contains 15 grams of protein, 0 grams of added sugar, simple ingredients and is made from the milk of grass-fed cows, making it a great option, according to Tamar Samuels, a registered dietitian and the co-founder of Culina Health. \u201cIt has a tart taste, but we love adding toppings like fresh fruit, chopped nuts, raw oats, and one to two teaspoons of honey or all-natural maple syrup for sweetness and texture,\u201d Samuels said.\nWorst: Dannon Fruit On The Bottom\n\u201cThis yogurt has around 20 grams of sugar depending on the flavor, and sugar is listed second on the ingredient list,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cThis product also has several additives and preservatives, including modified food starch and carrageenan.\u201d\nBest: Fage Greek Yogurt\nMade without any preservatives or artificial sweeteners or flavors, Fage Greek yogurt is a favorite of registered dietitian Karina Tolentino. She especially loves the 2% Total Split Cup with the fruit separated out on one side (the strawberry flavor is a great option), so you don\u2019t have to add all of it. \u201cIt has a smooth and creamy taste that is not tart, gives 12 grams of protein, and is not high in sugar,\u201d she said.\nWhile registered dietitian Stephanie Csaszar loves the idea of non-dairy yogurts, she said you should probably skip the So Delicious Vanilla Coconutmilk Yogurt. \u201cIt has next to no protein (less than 1 gram per 3/4-cup serving), only 2 grams of fiber, and too many added sugars at 17 grams \u2015 that\u2019s over 4 teaspoons of sugar!\u201d she said.\nDan Gallagher, a registered dietitian with Aegle Nutrition, said Siggi\u2019s skyr, with a whopping 18 grams of protein and 0 grams of added sugar in the plain option (and just 7 grams of added sugar in the flavored ones) can be a great pick if you\u2019re trying to lose weight. That\u2019s true of even the higher-fat options. \u201cIt has a high protein content and low caloric content,\u201d he said. \u201cIcelandic yogurt also tends to contain far less sugar than many Greek yogurts, which means it will be filling and help curb appetite for longer.\u201d\nWorst: Yoplait Whips\nWhen shopping for yogurt, Gallagher said people should skip the Yoplait Whips. \u201cThese yogurts are packed full of calories and sugar and they actually contain a smaller serving of yogurt than the average amount, so they certainly won\u2019t help curb cravings,\u201d he said.\nBest: Any Skyr-Style Yogurt\nSkyr, which has up to 17 grams of protein and 0 grams of added sugar for plain flavors, is always a great pick, according to Jen Scheinman, registered dietitian and nutrition affairs manager of Timeline Nutrition. And while Siggi\u2019s gets a lot of hype, there are plenty of other skyr-style yogurts out there, including Thor\u2019s Skyr or Icelandic Provisions. \u201cThis is a style of yogurt from Iceland, and it\u2019s much higher in protein than regular yogurt and has even more protein than Greek yogurt,\u201d she said.\nWorst: YoCrunch\nScheinman steers clear of the YoCrunch line of yogurts. \u201cThey add candy and cookies as toppers to yogurt, turning a highly nutritious food into a dessert,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s little protein and a lot of added sugar in this brand, which takes away from all the great health benefits of yogurt. These yogurts could be part of a healthy diet if used as dessert, but most people I\u2019ve worked with use them instead of a healthier yogurt option for breakfast or snacks.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for a plant-based yogurt option that\u2019s good for you, registered dietitian Anna Kalfayan suggested Siggi\u2019s plant-based coconut blend, specifically the mixed berry flavor, which has 10 grams of protein and just 7 grams of added sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s high in protein and low in added sugar,\u201d she said.\nWorst: Noosa Yoghurt\nAlthough delicious, Noosa yogurts are often high in sugar \u2015 the blueberry flavor, for example, has 31 grams of sugar, 18 gram of which are added sugar. \u201cWhen a yogurt has 20 grams or more of sugar, you have to ask yourself: Is this really necessary?\u201d Kalfayan said.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile there\u2019s no question that some yogurts are better for you than others, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s OK to have a little bit of everything in moderation. Just don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking you\u2019re having a healthy meal when you\u2019re really loading up your breakfast bowl with sugar.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-are-ultra-processed-foods_l_64186cdce4b0cfde25c60853": "You\u2019ve likely heard health experts say that eating whole foods and skipping processed foods is a key to optimal health. A December 2022 study, for example, presented a pretty scary statistic linking ultra-processed foods to cognitive decline, saying that people who ate more than 20% of their daily calories from processed foods had a 28% faster decline in global cognition and a 25% faster decline in executive functioning, compared with people who ate less than 20%.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what an \u201cultra-processed\u201d food is, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a complicated topic.\nMost foods are at least minimally processed \u2014 usually for preservation or safety reasons \u2014 so completely staying away from all processed foods can be difficult, if not impossible. It\u2019s also unnecessary.\n\u201cProcessed food tends to get a negative reputation, but there are many minimally processed foods that are actually good for us,\u201d Ashlee Wright, a registered dietitian at Orlando Health, told HuffPost. \u201cIf we think about foods, like baby carrots, nuts, chicken and fish, these have to be processed in some way, but they only have one ingredient.\u201d\nAt the other end of the processed foods spectrum are ultra-processed foods, like frozen meals, doughnuts, cookies and candy. These typically contain dozens of ingredients, many of which you\u2019ve never heard of and can\u2019t pronounce. These are the items nutritionists suggest limiting.\nStill, nutritionists acknowledge that understanding the difference between processed and ultra-processed foods is difficult. Here are some tips to help you sort them out.\nMost foods are processed, at least somewhat\n\u201cJust about all food needs to be processed to eat it, so this can be so confusing,\u201d said Colleen Tewksbury, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nThe healthiness of processed foods usually comes down to other ingredients, like sugar or salt, that are added during processing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines processed foods as those that have undergone changes to their natural state. So, it\u2019s any raw agricultural commodity that\u2019s been milled, cut, chopped, cooked, frozen, dehydrated or canned.\n\u201cMany foods that people think of as whole foods technically are minimally processed, like frozen fruits or vegetables, or those bags of pre-cut veggies at the grocery store,\u201d said Kristine Dilley, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\nProcessing techniques, like pasteurization, canning or dehydrating, also make foods safer to store and ensure they keep for longer periods of time, Dilley said.\nHow to understand the different kinds of processed foods\nNot all processed foods are created equal. One way to explain the different levels of processed foods is the NOVA food classification system, developed by researchers at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The system has four categories:\nGroup 1: Unprocessed or minimally processed foods. This refers to fruits, vegetables, seeds, eggs, fungi or milk that are consumed in their natural state or altered to remove inedible or unwanted parts, like stems or shells. The foods might be dried, filtered, roasted, frozen or packaged to preserve their natural state, store them or make them more palatable.\nGroup 2: Processed culinary ingredients. These items are derived from Group 1 or nature, and include oils, butter, lard, sugar and salt. They\u2019re usually used to prepare Group 1 foods and are rarely consumed on their own.\nGroup 3: Processed foods. These foods are produced by adding items, like salt, sugar, or oil (Group 2 items) to Group 1 foods. Examples include pickles, canned fish, cheese, canned fruits or vegetables, bacon or fresh bread. The foods usually retain their basic identity and some original characteristics.\nGroup 4: Ultra-processed foods. These items are created by industrial processes, like hydrogenation or adding emulsifiers, artificial colors, artificial flavors or preservatives. They include prepared meat, pasta or pizza; packaged bread, cookies or cakes; and soft drinks, candy, chicken nuggets or fast food. Ultra-processed foods tend to be highly palatable, inexpensive, convenient and contain multiple ingredients.\nOne issue with the NOVA system, Dilley said, is that it attempts to define the healthiness of foods in broad categories based on ingredients added during processing, which can be confusing for people. It also may inadvertently fuel the concept of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d foods.\n\u201cThis may be harmful to individuals who struggle with balanced eating or eating disorders, and may lead to an over-restrictive food intake,\u201d Dilley said.\nShould you limit ultra-processed foods?\nMany ultra-processed foods are convenient and inexpensive, compared to some whole foods, so avoiding them is difficult for most people, Dilley said. Plus, there\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying sweets or soft drinks sometimes.\nBut the more processed the food, the more likely it is to contain extra calories, salt and sugar.\nResearch has linked consuming high amounts of ultra-processed foods to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and dementia. And the previously mentioned 2022 study has linked ultra-processed foods to cognitive decline.\nIf you\u2019re eating processed foods, but are paying attention to the number of calories you\u2019re consuming overall, some ultra-processed foods may not be worrisome, Tewksbury said.\nTry sticking to the 80/20 rule, where you focus on eating unprocessed or minimally processed foods 80% of the time, Wright said.\n\u201cGive yourself some grace and realize that it can be challenging to avoid ultra-processed foods completely,\u201d Wright said.\nWhich processed foods are the healthiest to eat?\n\u201cThe simplest way to think about it is the fewer ingredients, the better,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIf you start reading an ingredient list, and you can\u2019t understand or even pronounce what\u2019s in it, try not to eat it often.\u201d\nChoosing healthy foods can be confusing, especially when labels say things like \u201call-natural\u201d or \u201cmade with whole grains,\u201d but contain a host of other ingredients that make them ultra-processed, Wright added.\nTo make sure you\u2019re opting for the least-processed options most of the time:\n- Look for items with five ingredients or fewer (or ones with the shortest ingredient list).\n- Note the first ingredient listed \u2014 that\u2019s what the item contains the most of (look for bread listing \u201cwhole grain\u201d first rather than \u201cenriched flour,\u201d for example).\n- Avoid (or minimize) products with added sugar, saturated fat and a high sodium content (20% or more of your daily value of sodium per serving is considered high).\n- Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible.\n\u201cI would encourage individuals to look at how often they are eating ultra-processed foods and in what quantity,\u201d Dilley said. \u201cPlanning ahead for meals and snacks, and doing any amount of meal prep can help reduce how often these convenience foods are needed.\u201d",

In \u201cBurnt,\u201d Bradley Cooper\u2019s character dives into the culinary arts to assuage his drug addiction; \u201cEat Drink Man Woman,\u201d the 1994 Ang Lee film, uses a family\u2019s standing Sunday night dinner plans as a point of reflection when it comes to dealing with sorrow and joy throughout life\u2019s up and downs.\nIt\u2019s clear: thinking, talking and looking at food soothes our spirit. This human tendency was never as pronounced in modern history as it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, when folks constricted to the household turned to cooking and baking to pass the time and, perhaps, alleviate a general sense of sadness.\nThe trend should come as no surprise, as there have been countless research projects on the topic.\nCreative activities like cooking and baking are directly connected to an increased sense of well-being, according to a 2016 study by the University of Otago in New Zealand published in the Journal of Positive Psychology.\nResearchers asked 658 university students to keep a record of their activities and associated mental states over 13 days. After partaking in creative pursuits \u2015 a common one among the subjects was cooking new recipes, according to a related study \u2015 students reported feeling more enthusiasm and positive growth than usual, the researchers found.\n\u201cThe act of cooking and the ability to prepare food is in itself a sacred act,\u201d said Dr. Sudhir Gadh, a board-certified psychiatrist with a private practice in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s something you do carefully and with focus. You don\u2019t do it while doing other things and you put care and love into it.\u201d\nThe ability to focus entirely on the task at hand \u2014 one that requires attention to detail, including specific measurements and constant monitoring \u2014 allows us to easily block out distractions that may cause stress and anxiety throughout the day.\nOf course, the characterization is not solely relegated to the kitchen. But there\u2019s something about the end result of cooking for oneself, from aromas to colors and flavors, that can deliver even more comfort than, say, crocheting or coloring.\n\u201cI find that the more time you spend cooking, the more time you want to spend eating and appreciating all the hard work you\u2019ve done,\u201d said Sarah Wagner, a registered dietician with Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. \u201cThat helps you to be more mindful, have less distractions and be more grateful for the moment.\u201d\n\u201cMany people find joy and calmness in baking, because it is very tactile and typically commands your full attention, primarily when you use repetitive motions with your hands,\u201d Kimberly Lou, the author of \u201cBecoming Who You\u2019re Meant to Be,\u201d told Fast Company in 2019.\nIn addition to its therapeutic effects, experts argue that eating food cooked by oneself will help our bodies function better on a biological level.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not feeling well and either don\u2019t eat or eat fast foods, you\u2019re not feeding the system that requires you to adjust its inflammation and therefore make the situation worse,\u201d Gadh said. \u201cIf you cook, the food is generally more digestible and it will help the body instead of harming it.\u201d\nWagner agreed, focusing on diet patterns over specific ingredients or foods. \u201cI suggest eating the rainbow and getting a lot of colors in your diet,\u201d she said. \u201cCooking with more whole ingredients is also important as it might lead you to use family recipes that will connect you to your ancestors and be good mood boosters.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, the dietician noticed the importance of using whole ingredients in the kitchen. \u201cSome people were just snacking all day because they were home while others embraced whole foods and cooking and those were the people that lost weight and felt healthier,\u201d she noted. \u201cI wish people could indulge in that slower-paced lifestyle again just to enjoy things and the experience of eating more. Convenience and quickness generally outweigh healthiness and appreciation of the meal. I noticed with my peers and patients that a healthy relationship with food goes a lot further than a single ingredient would on your mood.\u201d\nIn short: eat well, cook what you eat and don\u2019t focus too much on a single dish. It\u2019s all about the big picture.\nThose who thrive on specifics, though, should keep in mind that one of the most important aspects of staying healthy both mentally and physically involves the consumption of water, according to experts. \u201cWater is very good for mood, cognitive performance and energy levels,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cA lot of clients don\u2019t drink enough water but, once they start hydrating, they start to feel a lot better. When you\u2019re dehydrated, you\u2019re not going to work as efficiently.\u201d\nGadh echoed those feelings, suggesting drinking three liters of water a day to stay in shape.\nAnother tip from the psychiatrist involves the actual act of eating.\n\u201cWe have to look at meals as a sacred time and a meditative moment of connection and peace,\u201d he argued. \u201cIf you\u2019re eating while watching TV, for example, it delegitimizes the importance of breaking bread. Every dinner should be candlelit, feature small amounts of wine and basically be a moment for you to remove yourself from the stimuli that you\u2019re bombarded with all day.\u201d",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lap-band-weight-loss-surgery_n_6452b9c8e4b02df749cead8c": "I was 16 when I first learned about the surgery. My mother told me she had heard of something that could help me. Something that could fix me.\nThe lap band surgery would place an adjustable ring around the top portion of my stomach, thus restricting the amount of food I could eat. The procedure was non-FDA-approved for adolescents but was being offered as a study for ages 13 to 17. The idea was the lap band would help me feel fuller faster and that I wouldn\u2019t be categorized as a health risk any longer. That I would lose weight. That I would be normal.\n\u201cI want it,\u201d I told my mom, never so certain in my life. It felt right, like this was the answer I had been searching for. I was tired of dieting, wishing to lose weight every birthday and New Year\u2019s, throwing out clothes that no longer fit every year. I wanted more than anything to not be the fat kid, not be bullied or ostracized, and to be able to live the life I had always dreamed about. And after I had the surgery, I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it for over a decade.\nBefore the surgery, I thought about the weight I hadn\u2019t lost, the weight I could never lose no matter how hard I tried \u2014 all the diets I had failed, all the promises to myself I had broken. I felt like a failure, but now, I would be redeemed. This surgery would be my miracle.\nAs a pre-operation requirement, I had to maintain a liquid diet for two weeks to shrink my liver to provide easier and safer access when performing the laparoscopic surgery. I found it nearly impossible to restrict food for that long, but I was desperate, and when you\u2019re desperate, you find the strength to do things you never thought that you could.\nDuring those weeks, I brought a Slim Fast drink to school for lunch, careful to remove the label so that none of my classmates saw. I thought if I never addressed my problem body, it would be like it didn\u2019t exist. If anyone asked me why I was drinking out of a no-brand can and not eating lunch, I told them it was a protein shake.\nI missed a week of my senior year in high school for the surgery, and I made up some excuse as to why I was absent and why I couldn\u2019t participate in gym class for a month. It was easier this way. My surgery was a secret from everyone I knew.\nAt 17, I had been through almost every diet and exercise regime, only to see the number on the scale increase. People everywhere claimed that it only took the right diet, the right moment to change their lives. It was clear that if you were fat, you were broken. If you were fat, you needed to do something to change it.\nAfter the surgery, I started to lose weight without even trying. Halfway through a meal, I would become too full and have to stop eating or I\u2019d get sick. But I would get sick, and often. When I went to restaurants with friends, I\u2019d make up an excuse to go to the bathroom to vomit. I would pick at my food and shrug off comments about how little I was eating. I couldn\u2019t eat certain foods, such as bread, and when offered any, I\u2019d respond, \u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nBut although my body had changed, my relationship with food hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but I had an underlying eating disorder that had persisted my whole life. I\u2019d grown up not eating most of the day and eating large quantities at night, something not unusual for many Americans. However, this led to vomiting, a side effect of the lap band surgery, which contributed to my weight loss. In the years after the surgery, I continued to eat how I\u2019d always eaten and live how I\u2019d always lived: in a dysfunctional medical system in a dysfunctional society.\n\u201cIt was clear that if you were fat, you were broken. If you were fat, you needed to do something to change it.\u201d\nAlthough I had finally achieved my dream of losing weight, I was still uncomfortable in my body. I knew I was thinner, but I wasn\u2019t that thin. I didn\u2019t look like the women I saw on TV and in movies. My body was changing faster than my self-perception, and the truth I now know is that no amount of weight loss would have ever made me happy with my body.\nBut people did treat me differently, and that mattered more than what I thought about myself. They took time to listen to me and not just stare at my size. I found that I made friends easier and was getting attention from men \u2014 something that had never happened before. I finally felt accepted.\nStill, I was terrified that someone would discover my secret \u2014 not just the surgery, but the history of my body, the fact that I grew up bigger. I painted scenarios in my mind of rejection and ridicule from my friends, from strangers, as if \u201cfat\u201d was a terminal diagnosis.\nUp until recently, my surgery had remained a secret. I was ashamed of my body, the one that made me an outcast, a target for abuse, and I didn\u2019t want anyone to know about it. I didn\u2019t want to draw any more attention to my body, to how I was different. I wanted to disappear into normalcy. Aside from my parents, no one knew.\nThe few times I was required to tell, usually to medical providers, I was almost always met with widened eyes and raised voices. \u201cAt 17?\u201d I heard incredulous shock and judgment.\nI shrunk back into my body. They couldn\u2019t believe my parents would do that to me. They couldn\u2019t believe I was that bad as to require weight loss surgery. They looked at me differently, as if their perception of me had changed.\nBut they don\u2019t know the whole story.\nIn my early 20s, I started experiencing side effects from the lap band surgery. After undergoing an upper endoscopy, I found out that I had gastritis, esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease. I started wondering why and how this had happened. If the surgery was supposed to fix everything, then why was I having these medical problems?\nI discovered the terms \u201cbinge eating disorder\u201d and \u201ccompulsive overeating,\u201d diagnoses not incorporated into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 2013, six years after my surgery. I learned that these pathologies were symptoms of much larger problems: trauma, family dynamics, generational abuse, societal neglect, mental illness. Everything I had been taught to believe had been wrong, and I now needed to unearth the truth.\nMy relationship with food was attributed to a lack of self-control, gluttony and moral weakness, but I would learn that the issues with my mental health were never addressed or even acknowledged. It was as if I went to the emergency room with a broken leg and the doctors put a cast on my arm. The wrong part of me was being treated \u2014 and by treated, I mean blamed.\nNot long after I learned all of this, I became hyperaware, obsessive, fearful of food and of my body. I began exhibiting what are seen as more \u201ctraditional\u201d disordered eating behaviors, such as restricting and purging. And only then did people start to realize I had a problem.\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with my size. You cannot look at my body and know my story.\u201d\nHere is the real story: I started gaining weight at an early age. Every professional looked at my body as something that needed to be fixed, and yet now, 15 years after my surgery, I understand the mistakes that were made.\nThe problem was never my body. My body was manifesting the problems with everything else in my life \u2015 societal obsession with thinness, dysfunctional family environment, genetics, mental illness and more, as I would come to learn. It was complex, and our bodies hold all of these complexities.\nIn my mid-20s, I discovered how I ended up in this body and what had happened to me. I was able to finally take ownership of my body and of my story. I still have the lap band, but it is loosened and doesn\u2019t affect me as it used to, and I can eat now without the same fears.\nThe side effects from the lap band \u2014 the inability to eat and vomiting \u2014 had exacerbated my eating disorder. But I\u2019m in recovery now, which means that my mental health and my relationship with food and my body are more stable than they ever have been. This has nothing to do with my size. You cannot look at my body and know my story.\nWhen I was 17, I didn\u2019t know any of this because I grew up in a world where only things on the surface mattered. I didn\u2019t know what else to do to save myself from myself, so my family and I made a decision. We made a decision with the support of medical providers and current research to give me an opportunity to live a different story. We made a decision that, at 17, affected my life in ways I hadn\u2019t predicted, but I knew at that point I was in a losing battle. The battle would eventually end once I discovered that the battle wasn\u2019t one with the body, but with the mind. But the shame would linger.\nI have only just begun telling family, friends and co-workers about my surgery. And even after all these years, my breath still catches in my throat when I reveal my deepest secret, waiting for their reaction. Some people are surprised. Some are angry that I kept it a secret or that I would do that to my body, especially at such a young age. But most are receptive: The ones who truly matter to me don\u2019t see me any differently than before. But having a \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d childhood made me a victim in more ways than one, and so I had kept my surgery secret, as victims do.\nI wish I could say that 15 years after my surgery, this fear inside of me has disappeared, but I still have the urge to hide, to protect myself from the judgment and scrutiny of others and from myself. To keep my surgery secret. But shame lives in secrets, and I\u2019m writing now to rid myself of shame, to seek understanding and compassion not only from others but from myself.\nAmy Scheiner has had writing featured in Slate, Blue Mesa Review, the Southampton Review and Longreads.

One of the rising concerns Morticia (who asked to use a pseudonym because of digital safety) mentions is an increase in Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in marine environments.\nVibrio vulnificus can make its way into the body through eating raw or uncooked seafood, or exposing a wound to seawater where the bacteria is found.\n\u201cOysters are especially susceptible because they are filter feeders, so this bacteria can travel through into the organism and just kind of get stuck in its tissue,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cYou cannot tell if an oyster is contaminated with Vibrio bacteria by looking at it.\u201d\nThe bacteria doesn\u2019t make the oyster look, smell or taste any different, which makes it hard to tell you\u2019ve been exposed to Vibrio until you start experiencing symptoms. Although rates of infection are low overall, oysters have the highest amount of seafood related deaths in the U.S.\n\u201cIf you are healthy and what we call \u2018immunocompetent,\u2019 which really just means your immune system is able to work properly and eliminate infections, your body will be able to clear the infection without a hospital visit or antibiotics. But in the context of a tissue infection or someone who already has a compromised immune system, these infections can quickly turn fatal,\u201d Morticia told HuffPost. \u201cThis is where that high mortality rate we associate with Vibrio infections comes from.\u201d\nThe most recent outbreak was in 2019, causing gastrointestinal illnesses linked to oysters imported from Mexico. (No deaths were reported.) Climate change \u2015 which is causing a rise in sea temperature \u2015 has caused an increase in bacteria in water, leading to more cases of the infection.\nWhile you may not need to stop eating fresh oysters entirely, there are still important factors to consider. We asked general physicians, microbiologists and seafood distributors about the risks of consuming the shellfish, symptoms of Vibrio infection and treatment options. Here\u2019s what to know:\nSymptoms of Vibrio vulnificus include gastrointestinal problems and even sepsis.\nOysters are filter-feeders, so when bacteria attach to particles and other organisms in the water that then pass through the oyster, the shellfish can accumulate a concentration of bacteria up to 100 times that of surrounding waters. Since oysters are typically eaten raw, the infection risk is higher compared to eating cooked or boiled seafood.\nAs a result, there are an estimated 84,000 people in the U.S. who contract an infection from Vibrio every year. Timothy J. Sullivan, the national program leader at Animal Health and Aquaculture, a division of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, explained the differences between symptoms among healthy and immunocompromised people.\n\u201cIt typically results in mild GI distress with healthy individuals experiencing fever, chills, cramping, diarrhea or nausea within 48 hours of ingestion,\u201d he said. \u201cMortality is extremely rare in healthy individuals, but for individuals with certain medical conditions, it can cause severe side effects.\u201d\nImmunocompromised people are more vulnerable to infections, and since the immune system plays a role in defending the body from bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections, this puts them at a higher risk for complications, one of which is sepsis.\nPrimary sepsis, or the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection, appears in about 60% of Vibrio cases. People with certain illnesses \u2015 including people with chronic liver disease, diabetes, cancer, renal disease, HIV or other immunocompromised conditions \u2015 can more easily get sepsis, which can rapidly lead to tissue damage and organ failure if left untreated. Infections can progress rapidly when symptoms are severe. When gastrointestinal symptoms are completely absent \u2014 which happens in about 10 to 15% of people with the infection \u2014 cases of sepsis and death are minimal.\nIf you\u2019re an oyster fan, there are ways to reduce your risk.\nAlmost all of Vibrio infections stem from eating raw or uncooked oysters. As a result, several regulations have been placed to reduce risk through sanitation. The National Shellfish Sanitation Program, recognized by the Food and Drug Administration, ensures that shellfish-producing states are following safety guidelines, including certification, handling and process procedures.\nHowever, harvesting regulations do not eliminate the risk of Vibrio. As a result, shellfish states are providing customers with warning about infection risk. You may be able to find these on seafood packaging and menus.\nChristina Z. (who asked to keep her full name private for her job), a third-generation seafood industry professional and a seafood wholesale distributor, told HuffPost that eating oysters, whether from a grocery store or a high-end restaurant, doesn\u2019t change how the seafood is prepared. In a viral video she posted on TikTok, she shared that she would never eat raw shellfish.\n\u201cAs long as the oyster is eaten raw, the risk remains the same. Restaurants and grocery stores are both held to high standards to responsibly buy from reputable distributors and maintain the cold chain preventing any spoilage,\u201d Christina said. \u201cHowever, the preparation method to reduce the risk is key. Raw/uncooked oysters will always present the highest risk. If oysters are a must, opt for them steamed or baked.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re going to eat oysters, it\u2019s important to take note as to how the shellfish was prepared and where it comes from.\n\u201cSome safe seafood practices I would recommend is to buy most of your seafood flash frozen at sea if available,\u201d Christina said. \u201cThis maintains the integrity and peak freshness of the seafood, kills any living parasites and prevents the conditions needed for bacterial growth after the catch. However, if you do buy fresh, make sure to buy from a reputable monger who can tell you when the seafood was caught, and consume within one to two days after your purchase.\u201d\nAll coastal waters contain Vibrio bacteria. However, infections from Vibrio species are on the rise, and as mentioned, climate change can increase cases.\n\u201cMost bacteria relevant for human disease love warmth, and they need it to proliferate. Vibrio already likes heat. It lives in warm, coastal seawater,\u201d Morticia said. \u201cAs those waters get warmer because of a warming planet and climate change, they\u2019re not going to only grow to higher numbers in that water, they\u2019re also going to spread to new places as oceans that were once on the colder side become more temperate.\u201d\nThere\u2019s always a risk associated with eating raw oysters, Sullivan said. However, preventing consequences can start with preparation, knowing where your oysters come from, and recognizing symptoms of infection.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/farmers-market-worst-things_l_6418c1efe4b01ea5cd8fada1": "Farmers markets are a wonderful place to buy in-season fruits and vegetables, eggs, bakery items, honey and more. They also provide an opportunity to meet the people who grow or make your food \u2014 and a chance for you to accidentally annoy or offend them.\nSome customers may act differently at a farmers market than they would at a grocery store. Others might bring an attitude that can irritate vendors, or generally behave in a rude way.\nHuffPost spoke to market managers, farmers and vendors about some frustrating things that customers do. Here are the five biggest offenses they encounter.\nHaggling Over Prices\nShopping at the farmers markets lets you purchase directly from the people responsible for your food. This unique experience makes some customers feel like they can ask for discounts or negotiate the price \u2014 something you wouldn\u2019t consider doing at the grocery store.\n\u201cAll of the vendors at the markets either grow or handmake what they are selling; time, effort and money go into that. It is not a flea market,\u201d said Erin Mann, the owner of Erin\u2019s Elderberries and a board member of the Virginia Farmers Market Association. \u201cBy haggling a vendor on pricing for something they made with their bare hands, you are not only devaluing the item itself, but the person who spent their time doing it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting when a customer, usually a tourist from another state, insists on negotiating a price for a wedge of cheese,\u201d said Angela Miller, the founder and co-owner of Consider Bardwell Farm in Vermont. \u201cOur cheeses are artisanal, handmade, cave-aged and very labor intensive. We try to price them fairly, commensurate with the quality and costs.\u201d\nFarmers markets aren\u2019t a place to haggle or ask for discounts. \u201cWould someone argue the price of a $20 bottle of wine from a small vineyard?\u201d Miller said.\n\u201cAt busy farmers markets, the visitor who blocks a pretty display just to take multiple selfies is costing that farmer sales.\u201d\nSometimes customers don\u2019t haggle or ask for discounts but simply grumble about costs.\n\u201cWhen a customer gets out of their high-dollar car, walks up with a demeaning attitude and complains about the cost of the goods we are selling, this is irritating,\u201d said Craig Schmidt, the owner of Shaded Grove Farm Market in Mississippi. \u201cWe try to overcome this by sharing about our production methods and explaining that the actual cost of cheap, commodity food is much, much higher than what you pay upfront.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the only reason why buying directly from these farmers may seem more expensive. \u201cOur food system often hides the true cost of food by subsidizing commodity producers with your tax dollars,\u201d said Catt Fields White, the director of San Diego Markets in California. \u201cThose benefits rarely extend to small farmers.\u201d\nLetting Children Run Wild\nFarmers markets are a place for the whole family, but parents still need to keep an eye on their kids, just like they would anywhere else.\n\u201cWe love seeing families with children at farmers markets, but please keep your children in order,\u201d Schmidt said. He recalled an incident in which one child was touching eggs at his stall and \u201csoon the whole carton of eggs was scrambled on the sidewalk.\u201d\n\u201cWe had to clean it up,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t pay for it, either.\u201d\nJodie Kieliszewski, the founder of Bee Lovely Botanicals, also remembered times when parents lost track of their kids and items were damaged.\n\u201cThere was a small girl who was opening multiple lip balms, which are safety-sealed,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a matter of a few moments, she ruined about $40 to $50 worth of product, as well as wiping colored lip balm all over our display.\u201d\nBreaking Sampling Etiquette\nHaving the chance to sample foods before you purchase is one of the perks of shopping at a market. But if you know you have no interest in buying something or it\u2019s not going to be part of your shopping budget that week, you may want to reconsider before enjoying all the samples on offer.\n\u201cPeople [are sometimes] trying multiple cheese samples and then either walking away ... or saying that they would have to locate their spouse to get money, or also responding \u2018Will you be here next week?\u2019\u201d Miller said. \u201cThese comments are disingenuous.\u201d\nThere are also certain items that you should generally not sample, such as handmade soaps that shoppers may want to touch and smell.\n\u201cPeople bring multiple bars of soaps to their faces,\u201d said Erin Link, the owner of EB Ranch Farmstead in Wisconsin. She suggested that shoppers first \u201cask permission to pick things up and touch them.\u201d\nSnapping Photos Of Products Without Buying Them\nIn the quest for a great Instagram photo, many people take pictures or videos of booths while others are trying to shop, which can interrupt sales. Some markets have created social media rules to thwart this.\n\u201cWe have a saying: \u2018You tweet it, you eat it!\u2019\u201d White said.\nAt busy farmers markets, the visitor who blocks a pretty display just to take multiple selfies is costing that farmer sales,\u201d she added. \u201cFarmers need to sell what they\u2019ve harvested for the day.\u201d\n\u201cBy haggling a vendor on pricing for something they made with their bare hands, you are not only devaluing the item itself, but the person who spent their time doing it.\u201d\nStill want to snap a photo or make a reel? Ask permission from the seller to record their stall or display. If they say yes, be sure not to block other patrons from shopping.\n\u201cThe considerate influencer is one that loads up a shopping bag after they use that lovely background to create an eye-catching post,\u201d White said.\nArriving Before Opening Or After Closing\nFarmers markets have set hours, just like any retail store. The difference is, there isn\u2019t a door that locks and unlocks.\n\u201cWhen someone shows up early and asks to be sold to, that vendor has to stop what they are doing, find whatever that person is looking for or answer questions, and then also figure out how to promptly take payment,\u201d Mann said. This can disrupt the setup process, which in turn may prevent vendors from attending to customers in a timely fashion once the market opens.\nThe same is true for coming to the market late or at closing.\n\u201cVendors have to be off the premises by a certain time,\u201d Mann said. \u201cWhen everything is packed up and you\u2019re asking someone to undo 30 minutes of work, it can be construed as rude.\u201d\nYour local grocer, clothing store or restaurant isn\u2019t going to just let you come in whenever you want. So have the same respect for your vendors and allow them to put their best foot forward each week by giving them time to set up.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-foods-to-eat-for-covid-breakthrough_l_61f9a837e4b02136b6ed0887": "The rise of the COVID-19 omicron variant has resulted in many vaccinated and boosted people testing positive. And, as someone who contracted both the alpha variant (back in January 2021, before vaccinations were widely available) and the omicron variant this year, I can say firsthand that the COVID symptoms that I dealt with post-vax were far milder and shorter-term. Most notably, I was able to keep food down during my omicron outbreak (unlike the alpha experience, which left me constantly nauseated and unable to smell or taste what I was eating).\nThis felt like a massive relief, but when I went to place grocery delivery orders while quarantining, I did wonder whether there might be specific food items that could help boost my energy and ease my cold-like symptoms. This curiosity led me to consult some licensed nutritionists, who shared recommendations for seven food and drink items that can make breakthrough COVID easier to manage for people of all ages.\nVegetable Soup\nEven though my own personal experience with an omicron breakthrough didn\u2019t involve nausea, an unsettled stomach is still a common COVID symptom. For that reason, it makes sense that easy-to-eat (and easy-to-digest) foods like vegetable soup were popular recommendations from our nutritionist sources.\n\u201cWarm vegetable soup with a side of protein (like chicken or tofu) is my top choice because the vegetables will provide plenty of extra vitamins and minerals, which are especially essential in times of illness,\u201d registered dietician Morgyn Clair said.\nAlso, \u201cif someone is suffering from a sore throat or congestion, the warm fluids can help soothe these symptoms and help break up phlegm,\u201d Clair explained. She advises the protein addition because it \u201csupports healthy immune function, since all enzymes in the body are made up of proteins.\u201d\nBone Broth\nAnother soup that makes a smart menu addition for those grappling with breakthrough COVID is bone broth (or, if you\u2019re on a plant-based diet, vegan \u201cbone broth\u201d). Registered nutritionist Paula Doebrich told HuffPost that \u201cmost people experience poor appetite when they get COVID, so soup is an excellent way to get nutrients in. Making it with bone broth adds valuable nutrients, such as a higher protein content, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iron and other minerals. Many of these nutrients are needed for the immune system to function properly.\u201d\nDr. Frank Lipman, chief medical officer of The Well in New York City, described bone broth as \u201chydrating, nutrient-rich and supportive [of] immunity.\u201d It makes a great dietary addition for adults with COVID, he said, and is an easy form of sustenance for COVID-positive children who may find their appetites compromised by their illness.\n\u201cThe best thing you can do for your kids\u2019 health is avoid feeding them processed, sugary foods that lead to systemic inflammation and compromise immune function,\u201d Lipman said.\nBerries\nWhen looking for vitamin-rich foods to eat during a COVID infection, \u201cgo for berries, which are packed with antioxidants such as quercetin and vitamin C,\u201d said registered dietician and certified dietician nutritionist Linda Altenburger of the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York. \u201c These are necessary to reduce inflammation and provide resistance to infection by boosting immunity.\u201d\nBerries, explained Altenburger, \u201ccontain powerful antioxidants, called flavonoids, that are responsible for providing immune-boosting benefits.\u201d Flavonoids can \u201creduce free radical formation and oxidative damage, and contain anti-viral properties.\u201d\nWhile the scientific community is still studying the effect of flavonoids on COVID outbreaks, the National Institutes of Health says they\u2019ve shown \u201cpromising evidence\u201d against COVID, \u201cthereby reducing severity of illness.\u201d\nSo, go ahead and add blueberries, raspberries, strawberries or any other berry to your shopping list. They\u2019re also crowd-pleasers with children, and work well when you\u2019re trying to urge your COVID-positive child to eat.\nOatmeal\nOatmeal is an excellent source of fiber, which \u201chelps nourish the good bacteria in our microbiome and [sends] anti-inflammatory and virus-fighting signals to the immune system,\u201d according to owner, licensed nutritionist and head of research Shawn M. Talbott of Amare Wellness Center in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Plus, it\u2019s easy to zhuzh up oatmeal in healthy (and kid-friendly) ways. Talbott recommends adding \u201ca handful of blueberries and a scoop of whole-fat yogurt.\u201d\nCitrus Fruits\nMany of the symptoms associated with breakthrough COVID infections resemble those of the common cold, from congestion to coughs to sore throats. Citrus fruits like lemons, limes, grapefruits and oranges are often recommended for cold patients.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great source of vitamin C, a helpful antioxidant commonly known to boost the immune system,\u201d explained Jay Cowin, a registered nutritionist. \u201cThese same properties also make citrus fruits a wise choice for COVID patients. Vitamin C can also reduce and even prevent catching a cold; it may help fight off the infections faster and prevent any complications that these viruses might cause,\u201d\nCowin pointed out that \u201ccitrus fruits are affordable, convenient and can easily be enjoyed by adults and kids. They can be eaten or drunk, making them easy to consume even with a sore throat. There\u2019s no magic food that can completely protect us from any virus, but the best thing we can do is consume things that can help strengthen our immune system to fight off these diseases.\u201d\nWild Salmon\nIf you (like me) find yourself with a decent appetite in spite of breakthrough COVID, then consider adding a heartier source of protein to your diet, like wild salmon. \u201cOily fish such as salmon are packed full of healthy fats,\u201d said certified nutritionist Reda Elmardi. She noted that \u201comega-3 fish oil, which wild salmon contains, is a potent anti-inflammatory, which means it can play a key role in [treating] COVID cases, as has been shown in this study.\u201d\nWater\nFor adults and children dealing with COVID, hydration proves crucially important. \u201cWater performs many vital functions in the body,\u201d explained registered dietician Lyndsay Hall. \u201cBeing even slightly dehydrated can lead to or make worse the feelings of fatigue often associated with breakthrough COVID-19 symptoms.\u201d\nA fluid loss of just 1% to 3% can impact mental sharpness, focus and energy \u2014 all likely already compromised by a virus. Mancuso recommends \u201csipping on water throughout the day to keep you well-hydrated. If drinking water on its own is not up to your liking, try adding a slice of lemon for some zest. Tea performs a similar function to water.\u201d\nIf your COVID-positive kids have trouble drinking water (or simply prefer sweeter or more flavorful beverages), try Pedialyte, which registered dietician Ricci-Lee Hotz describes as \u201chelpful for children experiencing fever who are having difficulty drinking enough liquid.\u201d",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-pantry-staples_l_61d87348e4b0bcd2195ece16": "Having a well-stocked pantry can help you make healthier choices on weekdays, especially when dinnertime rolls around and you don\u2019t already have a plan in place. Pantry staples can be used to supplement fresh fruits and vegetables you already have on hand, or serve as an alternative to frozen pizza and instant ramen.\nWhen buying canned beans, broths, vegetables and other shelf-stable foods, it\u2019s worth taking a look at the nutritional labels, as these types of foods often have more salt and sugar than their fresh counterparts.\n\u201cDefinitely look at the sodium if you\u2019re at risk for high blood pressure or have high blood pressure,\u201d said Jonathan Valdez, owner of Genki Nutrition and spokesperson for New York State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming under 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day (and no more than 2,000 milligrams of sodium per day for people with high blood pressure), Valdez told HuffPost that the average American consumes about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day.\nIf you\u2019re watching your sodium intake, look for low-, reduced- or no-sodium options if they\u2019re available. In a similar vein, for canned fruits, experts recommend finding options in which the fruit is packed in its own juices or water (instead of syrup).\n\u201cLooking at the ingredients list to see if anything has been added is the best place to look for this,\u201d Meredith Price, a plant-based registered dietitian and co-founder of Plant-Fit Besties, told HuffPost.\nWe asked registered dietitians to share their go-to pantry staples and their favorite ways to use them. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up their top picks.\nNutritional yeast\n\u201cThis is a must in any plant-based person\u2019s kitchen,\u201d Price said, noting that nutritional yeast is a great source of protein, fiber and B vitamins. Plus, it\u2019s shelf-stable for up to two years and gives food a cheesy flavor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also low-FODMAP friendly, which is great for anyone with digestive issues, particularly IBS,\u201d she said.\nPrice likes to sprinkle nutritional yeast over popcorn for a healthy snack, and she also uses it to make vegan macaroni and cheese (mixing cashews with nutritional yeast to make a creamy vegan sauce).\nDried lentils\nLentils are a great source of plant-based protein, fiber and iron, Price said, adding, \u201cthey\u2019re a great meat substitute for many dishes.\u201d\nDried lentils are the star ingredient of some of her favorite weeknight meals, including daal (lentil stew) and lentil curry, which she serves with rice. When cooking with pantry staples, Price tries to incorporate at least some kind of fresh produce, even if it\u2019s just an onion.\n\u201cI like to have some fresh vegetables on the side to make the meal more flavorful and nutritious, such as a side salad, sauteed kale or roasted carrots,\u201d she said.\nWant specific recipes? Here\u2019s how to turn a bag of lentils into three meals.\nRice\nRice is a great base for adding proteins and vegetables, and any leftovers you have can be made into fried rice the next day. Throw in an egg, chopped garlic and whatever vegetables you have wilting away in your fridge and thank us later \u2014 leftovers have never tasted this good.\n\u201cIt goes with practically every dish and has a very long shelf life,\u201d Valdez said of the grain.\nAli Webster, director of research and nutrition communications at the International Food Information Council, is partial to brown rice because it\u2019s a whole grain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s higher in nutrients like fiber, manganese, magnesium and selenium compared to white rice,\u201d Webster told HuffPost.\nCanned vegetables that aren\u2019t in season\nIf fresh vegetables aren\u2019t available, frozen is the next best option. And then after that, canned options are good to have on hand.\n\u201cOn the rare occasions that I can\u2019t find the vegetables I\u2019m looking for in the grocery store, I love to turn to canned corn for something that\u2019s easy and microwavable, especially if corn is not in season,\u201d Valdez said. He uses canned corn in ramen, on salads and more.\nCanned beans\nCanned beans add fiber and protein to soups and salads, Webster said, and they can also be blended into dips like hummus or paired with tortillas and other toppings for weeknight tacos.\n\u201cThe versatility of canned beans is unmatched,\u201d she said.\nAt home, Webster and her family cook with a lot of pantry staples because they cut down on prep time and help get healthy meals on the table quickly. Unlike dried beans, which can take hours to soak and cook, canned beans can be heated up and added to dishes in minutes.\nNut butter\nWhether you like peanut butter, almond butter or some other type of nut butter, this is your reminder to stock up.\n\u201cNut butters are a source of protein and fiber, and they\u2019re high in healthy fats,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThey can be used for everything from toast to smoothies to sauces.\u201d\nWebster likes using peanut butter to make peanut sauces for dipping vegetables into or as a complement for rice noodle dishes.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/plant-milk-makers_l_61f18620e4b094ce54a52501": "I confess, I am no KonMari follower. My kitchen is stuffed with specialty appliances ranging from a Benedict egg maker to a miniature Bundt cake baker. But there always comes a time \u2015 usually after the turn of the year, when my husband is cleaning out but I\u2019m eyeing the after-holiday sales \u2015 when my husband looks at me and intones, \u201cNo more.\u201d\nThis January, with three different kinds of turkey fryers from the holidays still lingering out on the patio, I replied, \u201cNot even a plant-based milk maker?\u201d\nAnd I could swear, as an avowed oat milk drinker, he hesitated.\nWhat is plant-based milk?\nMost of us are familiar by now with soy, almond or oat milk. But plant-based (i.e., nondairy or vegan) milks really can be manufactured with any nuts, seeds, legumes, grains or even fibrous plant matter. From pea to hemp, these materials are first soaked, then pureed, strained and sometimes boiled.\nThe resulting milk is often sweetened with anything from agave to dates and flavored with spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon. If it\u2019s going on the market, it\u2019s also occasionally stabilized (with ingredients like carrageenan) or preserved (with other multisyllabic ingredients). Commercial nondairy milks are sometimes organic, and sometimes not.\nSo, should you make it or buy it?\nThe advantages to making your own vegan milks are manifold. For consumers like She L. Robinson, a public relations and branding strategist who is diabetic, it was initially about controlling her sugars and carbs. But the Georgia-based marketing professional quickly learned that her preferred healthy choices, walnut and pecan, were not widely produced. This led her to start rendering a variety of flavors, including hemp.\n\u201cHemp is what I have used to replace cow\u2019s milk in formula for my grandchildren who had an extremely hard time processing traditional formula, when mom wasn\u2019t consistent in milk production to keep up with baby\u2019s needs,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, have you had the chance to read the ingredients in the commercial baby formula? The list is outrageous.\u201d\nHowever, she does concede that she\u2019ll purchase the more popular choices, including coconut and oat milk, both out of convenience and because the products are good. \u201cBuying them is a lot easier than making them. I tend to go for Silk when I buy coconut milk and Elmhurst when I buy oat milk. These two are amazing in making sauces, creams or drinks that you want to have a heavier, more creamy texture.\u201d\nDarline Dorcely, chef and general manager of Chef Liline, a premium catering service based in Stamford, Connecticut, decries canned coconut milk. \u201cI prefer to make my own,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tastes so much better. It\u2019s fresh from the coconut and there are no preservatives.\u201d\n\u201cHomemade or store-bought, a good quality nut milk will supply vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and antioxidants,\u201d said Serena Poon, certified nutritionist and celebrity chef to clients such as Kerry Washington. \u201cSome of my personal favorite plant-based milks include almond milk, cashew milk, macadamia milk and pumpkin seed milk (a great source of zinc).\u201d\nStill, you\u2019re not likely to find macadamia or pumpkin milk in the local market. These are just some of the reasons you might want to, as she says, \u201cexperiment in the kitchen and deepen connections to your food.\u201d\n\u201cThat being said, I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone from buying packaged nut milk in the store if that is the better option for their lifestyle,\u201d Poon said. \u201cIt does become important to really check the labels on these milks. Opt for organic nut milk with few ingredients, ideally just two: nuts and water. Packaged plant-based milks tend to contain fillers and added sugar that can detract from their nutritional value.\u201d\nDo you really need a special appliance to make plant-based milk?\nThe short answer is no ... and yes. It depends on your lifestyle, comfort level and the amount of time you want to commit to working with the ingredients and cleaning them up.\nIt\u2019s not a difficult learning curve, but it can be time-consuming and messy. Some appliances will take care of everything for you \u2015 even dispose of the pulp \u2015 and all you have to do is put the right amount of ingredients in the machine, according to the accompanying recipe manuals. They don\u2019t even ask that you soak the materials first (soaking makes the milk creamy) because the mechanisms and technology inside the appliance will take care of that aspect. These appliances often resemble a cross between a food processor and a coffee maker.\nBut other tools are really just mills or even carafes, which means that you\u2019re responsible for soaking raw nuts, seeds or legumes first. Depending on the ingredients, that can take anywhere from six hours to overnight, and even up to 48 hours. Then you need to blend, strain and, in some cases, boil (which you must do with soy to get rid of certain chemical compounds). It\u2019s ... a lot.\nRobinson, who makes her milks daily, uses her Instant Pot Ace Nova Cooking Blender, which has a milk-making speed option, and a cheese cloth. But you can really use any blender.\nIf you do want a plant-based milk maker, which one should you get?\nIf you don\u2019t already have a blender or you need more guidance, there are a good number of home appliances on the market that are created specifically for making plant-based milks. They range from the simplest and most inexpensive products, like the Chef\u2019n Nut Milk Maker ($25) \u2015 a basic carafe that requires you to soak and strain \u2015 to the hard-to-swallow Almond Cow ($1,195), which creates 2 gallons in minutes without any prep at all.\nSome are very specific. For those who are single or the only vegan in the house, the Nutr Machine ($169) is a single-server. Tayama ($67.51) is only for soy milk, but also can cook other soy products. The VeganMilker by ChufaMix ($59.90) is compact and inexpensive, but requires that you already have an appliance to initially mill the materials.\nFor kitchen appliance fans, the most interesting ones lie in between, in the moderately priced options. The Soyabella Automatic Nut & Seed Milk Maker ($109.95) from Lifeboost (which is also marketed under the name Tribest) converts into a coffee or spice grinder, and also cooks soup. The ChefWave Milkmade ($209.95) is as easy to use as a coffee machine. It has preset programs for six different kinds of milks, along with a delayed start and auto-cleaning.\nIn the end, as long as we read labels, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to look at it. We get to decide how to invest our time and money: Supporting the producers making literal advances in the field or experimenting in the kitchen with our own appliances. As long as we have cabinet and counter space, that is.\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team.

That is, are we awakening to the abundance of sugar in the American diet and the toll it can take on health?\nWith today\u2019s announcement by the FDA and First Lady Michelle Obama that \u2018added sugars\u2019 will now be listed on the nutrition facts label \u2013 the black-and-white grid found on nearly every packaged food and beverage sold in the U.S. \u2013 I\u2019m hopeful.\nThe stakes are high: sugar consumption is helping drive growing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is also linked to cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and cavities.\nAmericans have not been able to assess the added sugars that are in many of their foods. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) included a critical building block for the new nutrition facts label when, for the first time, they recommended that no more than 10 percent of a person\u2019s daily calories come from sugar. This new daily value for sugar will also be listed on the nutrition facts label, giving consumers guideposts for where their sugar consumption should be.\nThe 10 percent upper limit on sugar is critical information. It\u2019s also sobering: a person can hit the 10% limit by drinking a 12 oz. can of soda, which contains nearly 10 teaspoons of sugar. Harvard\u2019s Nutrition Source has a list of drinks by brand and amount of added sugars \u2013 in teaspoons and grams \u2013 per 12 oz. serving. They also categorize the drinks by red (\u201cdrink sparingly and infrequently\u201d), yellow (\u201ca better choice but don\u2019t overdo it\u201d) and green (\u201cbest choice\u201d). From sodas to smoothies, flavored milks and sports drinks, the sugar content is eye-popping.\nA recent study showed that soft drinks and fruit juices are the top sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet. Cakes, cookies and pies follow. The study also found that nearly all \u2013 about 90 percent \u2013 of the added sugars Americans consume come from \u2018ultra-processed foods,\u2019 which includes sugar drinks, but also pizza, cereals, breads and other foods made with multiple additives along with salt, sugar and oils. The same study also suggested that Americans are getting more than half their daily calories from such \u2018ultra-processed foods.\nMomentum for the sugar awareness Zeitgeist can also be seen in city legislatures, which we\u2019ve been watching intently at the Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness. In 2014, voters in Berkeley, CA approved a sugar drink tax \u2013 the first city in the country to successfully do so. Oakland, CA put a similar tax on the ballot for November. Other municipalities are trying to do the same. Precedent suggests such taxes yield not only revenue to fund health, education and other needs, but potential positive outcomes for public health. Mexico began taxing sugar drinks in 2014 and sales dropped by 12 percent while water sales increased by four percent. Skyrocketing obesity and diabetes rates in Mexico drove the decision to tax sugar drinks.\nInformation is power. Highlighting \u2018added sugars\u2019 \u2013 not just total sugar content \u2013 on the nutrition facts label will tell a mom or dad making choices at the grocery store exactly how much extra sweetener has been put into a food or drink by the manufacturer. I hope that this new information on the label will prompt parents and other consumers to begin purchasing healthier products with less sugar, which in turn will initiate reformulation of products to contain less sugar. This label change represents an example of sound public health policy with the potential to move Americans toward better health.\nThere is a reason policymakers and consumers are paying heed; sugar is really not so sweet after all.\nCould it be we\u2019re entering a sugar awareness Zeitgeist? That is, are we awakening to the abundance of sugar in the American diet and the toll it can take on health?",

Food is just a really good thing.\nBut what we consider \"food\" has drastically changed over the years, helped along by a commercial food industry that creates processed, highly palatable snacks and treats that are actually designed to keep you eating.\nThis new age of convenience food is the subject of episode 7 of Next Level Living, a 10-part HuffPost Originals video series on the science behind our everyday habits. In this episode, we learn that some foods actually trick your brain into thinking you've consumed fewer calories.\n\"Essentially, the processing of food isn't just to make it safe or shelf stable. Processing of food is to maximize profit by maximizing the eating we do before we feel full,\" Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, says in the video.\nIn addition to packaged foods, restaurant meals have a lot of calories, and consumers aren't exactly helping themselves: In 2015, for the first time in history, Americans spent more money on dining out than they did on groceries.

    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthier-junk-food_l_5c7451e6e4b0bf1662023408": "We all have a complicated relationship with junk food. On one hand, it\u2019s completely delicious, comforting and flat-out fun to eat. On the other, it leaves us feeling tired and crabby shortly after eating it, and leads to unwanted weight gain, among other health issues.\nBecause we wholeheartedly believe in enjoying life, we don\u2019t want to discourage you from eating it altogether \u2015 we just want to remind you that you have options.\n\u201cFood cravings, especially for the unhealthy junk food stuff, are real and powerful,\u201d nutritionist Karina Heinrich, founder of the The Karina Method, told HuffPost. \u201cBut instead of fighting your craving, just feed it with a healthier version. There are many brands that are redefining the junk food scene, making needed strides with real ingredient innovation, so what we traditionally think of as \u2018junk food\u2019 can now actually be considered healthy.\u201d\nYep, you read that right \u2015 there are \u201cjunk foods\u201d out there that are actually pretty good for you. Here, three nutritionists explain which ones you should consider stocking up on for that 4 p.m. snack attack.\nPopcorn\nPopcorn isn\u2019t just a buttery delicacy to eat at the movies \u2015 it can also be a healthy snack. \u201cTry any kind of herb spiced popcorn, like this one from Trader Joe\u2019s,\u201d nutritionist Maya Feller suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s very crunchy and filled with fiber.\u201d\nSome other great popcorn options include Skinny Pop, Buddha Bowl Himalayan Pink Organic Popcorn and Angie\u2019s Boom Chicka Pop Lightly Sweet Kettle Corn.\nAnd, if you\u2019re looking for packaged popcorns to avoid, you\u2019d be wise to steer clear of traditional microwave popcorns, kettle corns that load in sugar (try to stay under 15 grams, if possible), and stay away from super-cheesy popcorns, which can pack on the fat, salt and vegetable oil.\nIce cream\nYes, you read that right. As long as you don\u2019t overdo it, ice cream actually has some good nutrients in it, like calcium and protein. And, if you switch it up from the traditional Ben & Jerry\u2019s pint, you may get even more of the good stuff, like probiotics and B-vitamins. \u201cAdonia by Ciao Bella and Enlightened are great options, as well as frozen Greek yogurt bars by Yasso,\u201d suggested Heinrich. \u201cRemember, though, one and done!\u201d\nGummy snacks\nSorry, but loading up on Sour Patch Kids isn\u2019t great for you \u2015 these sour gummy candies are packed with sugar, corn syrup, and artificial dyes. There are, however, some gummy snacks out there that aren\u2019t too bad for you. \u201cSome of my family favorite brands are Black Forest Organic, Newman\u2019s Own Organics and Surf Sweets,\u201d Heinrich said. These treats are just as delicious, but they\u2019re made with organic ingredients and are GMO-free.\nDark chocolate\nYes, you can have your chocolate and eat it too \u2015 especially if it\u2019s not packed with sugar! \u201cOn top of usually being lower sugar, dark chocolate actually has a decent amount of fiber and protein, and it\u2019s so intense that it\u2019s hard to overeat,\u201d nutritionist Tamar Samuels said. To avoid high-sugar chocolate, look for bars that are 70 percent cacao or higher.\nPotato chips that pack a healthier punch\nNot all chips are created equal, according to Heinrich. If you\u2019ve got a hankering for potato chips, worry not \u2015 they can actually be pretty good for you. \u201cYou can certainly get your chip fix without ingesting all of the harmful diet disasters that come along with it,\u201d she noted. \u201cMake sure to always choose chip brands that do not contain MSG, which is a common additive in chips and is linked with headaches, allergic reactions, and obesity. Kettle Brand chips are a great clean ingredient option.\u201d\nDang coconut chips\nWhile coconut chips may not be the first thing that pop into your mind when you think of a traditional junk food, hear us out: Dang brand coconut chips are a great, healthy way to satisfy that sweet-salty craving. \u201cThey have some fat and fiber, which help you to eat them in moderation,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cThey also make some great salty-sweet options, if you like that combo.\u201d\nTortilla chips (or something like them)\nThese days, you have a ridiculous amount of options in the tortilla chip aisle, and many of them are packed with nutritious ingredients. \u201cLots of chip brands are getting on the healthy bandwagon and coming out with chips that are made from high-fiber ingredients, often high-protein beans and other good-for-you whole grains,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cSome are even made from kale, seaweed and other greens, versus just your traditional potato. Beanitos bean chips taste like tortilla chips minus the junk food ingredients and are perfect for dipping into delicious guacamole. Siete Foods Grain Free Tortilla Chips is another great option that even has a nacho flavor. You may possibly never eat another greasy chip again.\u201d\nRamen\nAh, ramen \u2015 is there anything more comforting? While the traditional packaged variety packs the MSG and high sodium, there are some healthier options out there. \u201cNot too many brands replace this college-age favorite, but I do like Lotus Foods,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cNeed to prepare the original style as a healthy meal? Add frozen veggies, eggs, skip the seasoning packet and instead sprinkle your own sea salt, miso or low-sodium soy sauce.\nOne more thing to keep in mind? Giving in to your flat-out \u201cbad\u201d junk food cravings once in a while isn\u2019t always the worst idea. \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about mindful eating,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cIf you do have a craving, sometimes it is best to honor it. Don\u2019t eat the whole bag. Instead, serve yourself and put a portion of the snack you want on a plate or in a bowl so you can be more intentional about portion size and more mindful about how much you need to feel satisfied.\u201d\nAmen to that.",

Sure, but first, you should probably check on last night\u2019s leftovers \u2014 just for a quick little bite. Starting a project? You\u2019ll need brain food, obviously. Of course, you\u2019ve already had breakfast (and lunch \u2014 and snacks).\nFood can be a remote worker\u2019s worst enemy, and sometimes the efficiency of working from home leads to people straight-up forgetting to eat at all.\nSince overeating and undereating aren\u2019t sustainable habits, we talked with veteran remote workers about their tried-and-true strategies for eating healthily while working from home.\nStick To A Schedule\nSuccessful freelancers swear by routines \u2014 washing your face, putting on real clothes and setting smartphone boundaries \u2014 and those recommendations extend to eating. Nutritional therapist and longtime work-from-homer Wilma MacDonald told HuffPost that snacking here and there is the biggest mistake she sees new remote workers make. She recommends setting up your day like any regular working day, with a lunch break, a few smaller breaks and a focus on the most important meal: breakfast.\n\u201cEat breakfast away from your desk before you start work,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cThink of something like warm oats with nut butter and fruit, or avocado and eggs on toast. Protein-rich breakfasts keep you full and keep your sugar levels balanced so you\u2019re not looking for a snack in an hour.\u201d\nLucille Whiting, founder of jewelry brand Sophia Alexander, has juggled working from home with five kids for the past 14 years. She recognizes schedules are a bit crazy, but finds following the needs of her children works best. \u201cI try to eat when the children are eating, so breakfast with my toddler, lunch together before his afternoon nap and dinner all together in the evening,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cI buy or make cakes and biscuits for the children after mealtimes, but often make just enough for them to help me avoid temptation.\u201d\nWhen You Can, Eat Away From Your Desk\nIt\u2019s easy to think eating breakfast or lunch at your desk could help you end the day early, but work-from-home veterans know it rarely works this way. There\u2019s always something more to do, and your focus dwindles without dedicated breaks. That\u2019s why MacDonald suggests eating all meals away from not just your desk, but your tech.\nWhiting agrees \u2014 she institutes a no-tech at dinnertime rule \u2014 but she will work through lunch when her kids are occupied. For her, parenting while working from home is all about being flexible. \u201cHaving a total break from work helps clear my mind, but if I\u2019m on my own when the children are sleeping or out, I almost always eat lunch at my desk,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always the temptation to keep working and get as much done as possible. Having the children around gives my day a healthy structure.\u201d\nSet Caffeine Boundaries And Increase Hydration\nThose new to the work-from-home lifestyle are often astounded by how much coffee they drink. If you brew a pot, you don\u2019t want to waste any, and you end up drinking way more than you ever would at work. Surprisingly, this isn\u2019t the worst thing you could do for your health. The FDA says 400 milligrams (the equivalent of four to five cups of coffee) is typically safe, depending on the person. The important thing is timing.\n\u201cIf you drink caffeine, have your coffee between 9 and 11 a.m.,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cThis is the best time to have caffeine so that it doesn\u2019t interrupt your natural sleep and wake cycle by triggering a release of adrenaline and setting you up for a crash in an hour.\u201d\nCoffee gets people out of bed in the morning, but the same can\u2019t be said for water. A 2016 report by the CDC showed most American adults between 20 to 60 years old drink barely enough water, while adults over age 60 drink less than recommended. In addition to hydration benefits, MacDonald says water can help people feel full, because thirst is often mistaken for hunger.\nWhiting\u2019s go-to hydration trick is to make water easily accessible. \u201cI keep a pint glass of water on the worktop at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cThe glass sitting there acts as a reminder, and it helps me avoid unnecessary snacking when I\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d\nKeep Healthy Snacks Ready\nYou don\u2019t want to overdo it with snacking, but you also don\u2019t want to starve yourself. That\u2019s why MacDonald recommends taking personal inventory prior to hitting the refrigerator. \u201cBefore you head to the snacks, check in with yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you eating because you\u2019re hungry or because you\u2019re bored, stressed, annoyed or lonely? We eat our emotions from time to time. Feel those feelings \u2014 especially now \u2014 then have a drink of water.\u201d\nWhen it is hunger, not procrastination or emotions, MacDonald leans on go-to snacks like chopped carrots, pepper, celery with hummus, or stuffed dates with nut butter. \u201cSmoothies are also good to have because they\u2019re hydrating and you\u2019re getting a boost of goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cStart with a base of a green vegetable, add fruit, some protein like chia seeds or protein powder, and some fat like nut butter.\u201d\nWhiting says fruit is her favorite snack, and it\u2019s something her children can enjoy, too. \u201cI have loads of apples and pears around, which is easy with small children,\u201d she said. \u201cI buy a lot so they have healthy things to snack on, and I buy extra for whenever I get hungry between meals.\u201d\nBut sometimes, snacking isn\u2019t the answer. Judy Bartkowiak, author and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) trainer and 30-year work-from-home veteran, sticks to a disciplined, no-snack approach. \u201cI eat a big healthy breakfast, and stick to eating three times a day,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cThat way, I don\u2019t even think of going to the fridge during the work day except to get something at lunchtime.\u201d\nKeep A Food Journal\nNutrition is highly personal, and what works for one person may not work for another. That\u2019s why MacDonald recommends journaling during your first few weeks working at home. \u201cKeep track of how you\u2019re feeling over the course of the day energy-wise, and keep a food diary to see any patterns emerging,\u201d she said.\nAt the same time, self-isolation due to a pandemic is different than casually working from home. It\u2019s all about adapting to these emotional weeks and months, and taking life in stride.\n\u201cYou might find yourself eating everything at first, then you realize how sluggish it makes you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes a while to find your groove, and these are weird times. As people adapt to working from home, they need to give themselves grace.\u201d",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/handwritten-menu-study_l_5c7568e2e4b02efbde1f2f62": "The menu at your favorite healthy restaurant might be trying to tell you something \u2015 and it\u2019s not just the daily specials.\nA 2019 Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University study that will be published in the Journal of Business Research found that diners eating in a health-focused restaurant are more likely to associate that restaurant with healthiness if the menu features a font that is handwritten, or appears to be.\nAccording to the study, these menus also make you more likely to post photos of your food on social media.\nStephanie Liu, lead author of the study, explained to HuffPost that as more people are focused on \u201ceating clean,\u201d she and her colleagues were interested in offering restaurants, well, a hand.\n\u201cMany restaurants are branding or rebranding themselves as healthy, but they might not know how to do it effectively,\u201d Liu told HuffPost. \u201cWe wanted to help these restaurants by offering a creative marketing strategy that does not necessarily increase cost \u2014 you just need to print your menu in a different font that appears handwritten.\u201d\nThe study, conducted with 185 people ages 20-84, set out to determine if a \u201chandwritten\u201d menu can better convey love or evoke more of a human touch. Participants were split up into four groups and asked to imagine they were eating in a made-up restaurant called Rilo\u2019s Kitchen.\nAccording to the study, two groups were presented with the following statement explaining that the eatery was health-conscious: \u201cIts entire menu is based on locally-grown, non-GMO, antibiotic-free ingredients and it is committed to sustainability.\u201d\nOf those participants, one group was given a menu with a handwritten font, while the other group received menus that did not appear handwritten. The researchers found that participants who received handwritten menus expressed more favorable attitudes toward the menu, perceived the food to be healthier and engaged with it on social media at a higher rate.\nHowever, these differences were only apparent when the restaurant was described as \u201chealthy.\u201d The different menu fonts didn\u2019t have any perceivable effect on the two groups that were not informed of the restaurant\u2019s health focus.\nAccording to Liu, that\u2019s a result of our attitudes toward fast food or regular restaurants in general. \u201cAt regular restaurants or with fast food, the typeface doesn\u2019t matter as much because you\u2019re not expecting that human touch or extra effort,\u201d Liu told MarketWatch.\nFor James Rigato, head chef at Mabel Gray in Hazel Park, Michigan, it\u2019s not necessarily health that drives its handwritten menu, but certainly an emphasis on connecting with the customer.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pursue the optics of healthy but definitely fresh and handmade,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cA lot of American food in general is unhealthy so I think handmade often correlates to healthy, but the handmade part of it is more important for us to convey.\u201d\nRigato\u2019s girlfriend Sam Stanisz, a sous chef at the restaurant, handwrites the menu daily, and Rigato says it\u2019s become engrained into the restaurant\u2019s overall aesthetic and vibe. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly human touch, like when someone sends a handwritten thank you note,\u201d he said.\nBut not everyone is picking up what the study is writing down.\nBasing notions about a restaurant on the menu alone is \u201coversimplifying\u201d what goes into branding a restaurant as health-focused, Douglas Riccardi, owner of New York City-based restaurant branding agency Memo Productions and Type Director\u2019s Club board member, told HuffPost. He noted that in general, restaurants are now doing a lot more to send out a healthy message.\n\u201cThe entire messaging in restaurants has become much more transparent about how ingredients are sourced, how the food is prepared, even calorie counts,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are just more open now and there\u2019s less of a desire to hide things under the rug.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s an interesting idea to keep in mind the next time you order off a menu \u2015 handwritten or not.",
    "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nutritionists-rank-thanksgiving-side-dishes_l_5fac0ff8c5b6ed84597d525c": "Everything Thanksgiving: Get all our Thanksgiving recipes, how-to\u2019s and more!\nWhile turkey has its fans, many people see the side dishes as the real stars of the Thanksgiving meal. But when it comes to nutrition, not all sides are created equal.\nPlenty of Thanksgiving favorites are drowning in butter, sugar and other unhealthy ingredients \u2015 even those that seem \u201chealthy\u201d due to their vegetable content. That\u2019s no reason to avoid partaking in the festivities or feel shame for eating an indulgent meal, however.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if you can lighten up some of those decadent Thanksgiving dishes and cut out some of the excessive sodium, sugar and fat without sacrificing flavor,\u201d said Stefani Sassos, a registered dietitian for the Good Housekeeping Institute. \u201cBut my cardinal rule with Thanksgiving and holidays in general is to eat what you want but listen to your body and respect your fullness.\u201d\n\u201cSome of these foods only come around once a year and are just too good to pass up!\u201d she added. \u201cAs a registered dietitian, of course I try to choose healthy items, but I know that if you restrict too much, it may ultimately backfire and you\u2019ll wind up eating more than you would have in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cPick and choose your absolute favorite items, portion out a serving, and sensibly indulge,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can still enjoy your favorite foods in moderation and avoid that Thanksgiving food coma.\u201d\nStill, for those who would like to learn about the dietary properties of different Thanksgiving sides, HuffPost asked nutritionists to rank these dishes from healthiest to least healthy and to share their tips for upping the nutritional value of each option.\nIt\u2019s important to note that nutritional rankings can be subjective and based on an individual\u2019s current health goals, and that preparation plays a major role in how healthy a side dish can be. The below list reflects an average of each nutritionist\u2019s individual rankings.\n1. Brussels Sprouts (Healthiest)\nBrussels sprouts may not be a showstopping Thanksgiving side dish, but these cruciferous vegetables can bring some real nutrient value to the table. They\u2019re a great source of vitamins A, C and K, and researchers tout their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\nPreparation style can limit their health impact, however.\n\u201cBrussels sprouts themselves are rich in fiber and nutrients, but if they\u2019re saut\u00e9ed in duck fat and loaded with salt (that\u2019s how they are commonly prepared in many restaurants), it kind of defeats the purpose,\u201d Sassos said. \u201cAir frying Brussels sprouts is my favorite way to prepare them and substantially cuts down on the calories and fat.\u201d\nConsider roasting them with a small amount of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or preparing a shaved Brussels sprouts salad. Cooking Brussels sprouts with bacon can add extra fat and increase your intake of animal fat and red meat, but some experts believe a little bit of bacon isn\u2019t the worst option, as it may help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins and keep you satiated.\n2. Butternut Squash\nButternut squash doesn\u2019t just make for a lovely fall display. It also packs a serious nutritional punch.\n\u201cButternut squash is a great source of vitamin A, B, C and E, as well as calcium, magnesium and zinc,\u201d said Brianna Bernard, a nutrition coach and Isopure spokesperson. \u201cThis is great roasted in a little olive oil and also makes a delicious soup!\u201d\nFilled with immune-boosting nutrients, butternut squash is tasty without unhealthy add-ons, so it\u2019s not necessary to use a super buttery or sugary recipe. It\u2019s possible to make a good butternut squash soup with little to no milk and cream as well. Still, caramelizing it with just a little bit of butter can add some extra sweetness.\n3. Green Bean Casserole\n\u201cGreen beans are loaded with vitamins A, C and K, as well as fiber, but this dish can be high in sodium due to the cream of mushroom soup, soy sauce and fried onions,\u201d said Bernard. She advised replacing these ingredients with a low-sodium soup and coconut aminos.\nConsider substituting caramelized onions or whole-grain bread crumbs for the crispy fried onions and skipping the can of cream of mushroom soup. Instead, add mushrooms and some milk or Greek yogurt to your dish for the same creamy richness.\n\u201cMix in some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, onion, garlic, and celery,\u201d suggested Kimberley Rose-Francis, a registered dietitian nutritionist. \u201cThen add a pinch of flour, salt and pepper with a splash of low-sodium vegetable broth for a cream-of-mushroom soup flavor.\u201d\nYou can also make a simple roasted green beans recipe or green beans almondine instead of the casserole.\n4. Sweet Potato Casserole\nSweet potatoes are a great source of fiber, beta-carotene, vitamins A, B and C, and more. But sweet potato casseroles tend to be loaded with butter and sugar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really more of a dessert than a side dish once you count up the sugar content,\u201d Sassos said, pointing to the marshmallows and brown sugar in many classic recipes. \u201cRoasting sweet potatoes and adding a touch of maple syrup would be a far healthier option that tastes great, too.\u201d\nAnother healthier alternative would be preparing sweet potatoes with cinnamon, which \u201chas been tied to reducing inflammation, increasing insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels,\u201d said Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, registered dietitian and author of \u201cThe Better Period Food Solution.\u201d\nYou can also incorporate nuts, raisins, nutmeg and cardamom, or consider coconut swaps like coconut sugar or coconut oil.\n5. Mashed Potatoes\n\u201cMashed potatoes may have a bad rap, but the spud has plenty to brag about: potassium, fiber, even a bit of vitamin C,\u201d said registered dietitian nutritionist Jill Weisenberger. \u201cYou can health-ify them by using less fat such as butter or cream cheese.\u201d\nInstead, she suggested a combination of butter, olive oil and chicken or vegetable broth. Other alternatives to heavy cream and butter include almond milk and yogurt.\n\u201cOne excellent way to up the fiber and nutrient content of mashed potatoes is to leave on the skin of the potatoes, where many of the vitamins and much of the fiber is found,\u201d said nutritionist Alyssa Northrop. \u201cMany people actually prefer the taste of skin-on mashed potatoes once they\u2019ve tried it. Try roasting a head of garlic and smashing it along with your potatoes for even more nutritional benefits.\u201d\nAnd of course, you could always go the cauliflower route \u2015 either as a replacement or a supplement.\n\u201cMashed cauliflower can be mixed into your mashed potatoes,\u201d suggested Stephanie Snell, a registered dietitian at UCHealth. \u201cIf you are looking for one less starch on your table, you could prepare mashed cauliflower in place of mashed potatoes.\u201d\n6. Dinner Rolls\n\u201cUnless they are made with whole grains, I would steer clear of dinner rolls, which load you up on processed carbs without providing much fiber,\u201d Northrop said.\nIndeed, classic white bread dinner rolls don\u2019t offer much nutritional value, though the whole grain versions are healthier.\n\u201cWhole grains contain B vitamins which are needed for energy production, as well as fat and protein metabolism,\u201d Rose-Francis said. \u201cOne should be careful of how much butter is added to their bread. Whether your rolls are made of whole grains or refined grains, extra butter can make them unhealthy.\u201d\n7. Cranberry Sauce\n\u201cCranberries are an excellent source of antioxidants like polyphenols that help repair cell damage and have been shown to help reduce heart disease risk factors such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure,\u201d Beckerman said.\nResearch has also shown that cranberries are rich in vitamin C, promote urinary tract health and reduce inflammation.\n\u201cCranberries are a superfruit, but all the sugar in the canned stuff and traditional recipes undoes their greatness,\u201d said registered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner. \u201cMake cranberry sauce with 50% less sugar, and it will still taste great. Or use just a little honey and some fresh-squeezed oranges and you can ditch white sugar altogether.\u201d\nA little maple syrup and orange zest can also serve as good sugar replacements. Northrop noted that homemade cranberry sauce made with the actual cranberries with their skins also contains more fiber and other nutrients.\n8. Stuffing\nWhile stuffing is a fan favorite, it\u2019s the source of many hidden Thanksgiving calories due to its high sodium, carbohydrate and fat content. The dish is often prepared with refined breads, lots of butter and high-fat proteins like sausage and bacon.\n\u201cTraditionally, we choose our more processed grains for the bread in stuffing,\u201d Snell said. \u201cChoosing whole grain bread can reduce your intake of processed grains and increase your intake of fiber.\u201d\nSassos suggested making stuffing with cauliflower rice or whole wheat bread \u2015 or portioning it out into muffin tins and baking \u201cstuffins.\u201d Bernard recommended low-sodium chicken broth. But the biggest tip from multiple nutritionists: Load up on veggies.\n\u201cSpinach or mushrooms could be an ingredient in your stuffing,\u201d Snell said. \u201cWhen possible, we want to increase the use of vegetables throughout our sides.\u201d\nCelery, onion carrots, kale and sweet potatoes can also increase the fiber and nutrients and decrease the calories in a serving of stuffing.\n9. Macaroni And Cheese\nTraditional macaroni and cheese doesn\u2019t offer much in terms of nutrition, between the refined grains, butter and cheese.\n\u201cYou can get decent amounts of protein from the cheese, but the fat and carbohydrate content is very high, which means the dish ends up being very calorie-dense,\u201d said Jonathan Valdez, owner of Genki Nutrition and spokesperson for the New York State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nHe suggested adding vegetables to the dish, using a fat-free or reduced-fat cheese and choosing a whole wheat, lentil or chickpea pasta to increase the fiber and protein content while reducing calories. Keeping portions smaller can also be helpful.\n10. Gravy\n\u201cTurkey gravy is often made from grease drippings and the neck and giblets from the Thanksgiving turkey,\u201d Bernard explained. \u201cThese fatty ingredients make it taste delicious, but are not very healthy \u2015 especially when coupled with more high-sodium chicken broth and butter.\u201d\nThe high saturated fat and sodium content mean it\u2019s best to be mindful of portion sizes when ladling out the gravy. There are also ways to make it a bit healthier.\n\u201cInstead, create a roux using a lighter fat, like a plant-based butter, and flour,\u201d Rose-Francis advised. \u201cTry using less meat drippings and adding vegetable stock to enhance the flavors even more. Stir and simmer, simmer and stir ... and voila! Your savory \u2018silky sauce\u2019 is served.\u201d"
