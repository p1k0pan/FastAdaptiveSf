Congress could slow the growth of debt by cutting spending and raising revenue, but Republicans have ruled out the latter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to raise taxes,\u201d House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday. \u201cWe have more revenue coming into government in a 50-year average than any other time in history, only two other times did we have a higher percentage.\u201d\nRepublicans have refused to support a bill raising the debt ceiling, which would allow the government to continue borrowing to pay for basic operations, unless President Joe Biden agrees to spending cuts. The White House has privately proposed closing tax loopholes, such as the favorable treatment of investment fund managers\u2019 income, as part of a broader deal, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes hostage situation \u2014 the government could default on its debts in less than two weeks, potentially destabilizing the financial system and skewering the economy.\nMcCarthy\u2019s claim about record revenues is a little outdated. The historical average for tax revenue as a percentage of overall economic activity \u2014 a common metric for measuring the scale of the tax burden \u2014 is about 17.4%, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that hates budget deficits.\nTax receipts clocked in at about 20% of gross domestic product in 2022, but have been trending downward, and amounted to 17.7% of GDP in the past 12 months, according to more recent budget data analyzed by CRFB. So revenue has been coming in at the historically average pace.\n\u201c2022 was a fabulous revenue year, but it wasn\u2019t indicative of a trend,\u201d CRFB\u2019s Marc Goldwein said in an interview, adding that inflation and lots of stock sales contributed to the surge of tax receipts last year.\nMcCarthy implied that having more revenue than the historical trend means the government has more than enough, but the historical trend, after all, was a key ingredient in the recipe for a $31 trillion national debt. McCarthy has called the debt \u201cthe greatest threat to our future.\u201d\nOn spending, McCarthy\u2019s on firmer ground.\n\u201cWe are spending more than at any other time,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe are now more than 24% of GDP spending when on the 50-year average we\u2019re at 21%.\u201d\nOverall federal spending surged to 30% of GDP in 2020 thanks to the largely bipartisan response to the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s trended downward since then as boosts to food benefits and Medicaid coverage expire. But spending has leveled out at an above-average rate, and the Congressional Budget Office has projected that outlays will remain elevated through the next decade as more older Americans receive benefits from Social Security and Medicare \u2014 programs McCarthy has said Congress won\u2019t touch.\nSo spending is up. But even if it weren\u2019t, it\u2019s unlikely that fluctuations in revenue and expenses would make a difference to Republicans, who always favor tax cuts and always favor spending cuts when a Democrat occupies the White House.\n\u201cWe have a spending problem. It\u2019s not that the American people are taxed too little,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost last week. \u201cI understand that the impulse of our friends on the left is to grow the government and raise taxes, but I think just the opposite is right. It\u2019s the difference between Republicans and Democrats, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d\nThe White House proposed a budget earlier this year that would significantly narrow deficits through higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, but Democrats have not made higher taxes a prominent public demand in response to the Republican push for spending cuts attached to a debt ceiling increase. Instead, President Biden simply insisted that Congress pass a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling bill without any strings attached, and tax policy demands have been made in private negotiations.\nIn those talks, the White House has offered to freeze discretionary spending at current levels, but Republicans want spending to revert to a lesser amount, and they want \u201cwork requirements\u201d restricting eligibility for federal food and health benefits.\n\u201cThe fundamental issue here is the spending,\u201d Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe have to spend less money next year.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/debt-limit-republicans-biden_n_646cc549e4b0005c605c0ff6": "WASHINGTON \u2015 House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) rejected cutting spending on the military even as he portrayed the rising debt as an existential threat to the nation that needed to be urgently addressed in negotiations with President Joe Biden.\n\u201cDefense should not be on the table,\u201d McCarthy told reporters after a \u201cproductive\u201d meeting with Biden at the White House on Monday that yielded no agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.\nIf lawmakers can\u2019t reach a deal, the federal government could default on its obligations as soon as June 1. A default would be unprecedented, throwing the entire financial system into chaos and wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy here and around the world.\nRepublicans have demanded significant spending cuts in exchange for lifting the federal government\u2019s \u201cdebt ceiling,\u201d a legal limit on how much the government can borrow to pay bills Congress has racked up over the years.\n\u201cThe national debt is like a credit card,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News recently, employing his favorite metaphor. \u201cYear after year after year, Washington keeps hitting the limit, so they just keep expanding it. Now, America\u2019s credit card debt is higher than what we make in an entire year. Shouldn\u2019t we reevaluate how Washington is spending your money?\u201d\nWhen they controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2017, Republicans went on a massive spending spree while also cutting taxes \u2015 without making any fuss over the debt limit. In fact, they raised the debt limit three times with no demands for multi-year caps on spending like they\u2019re asking Biden to agree to now.\nA similar fight over the debt limit played out in 2011 under a different Democratic president, Barack Obama, who ultimately agreed to cut spending equally split between defense and non-defense programs.\nThis time around, Republicans are insisting on actually increasing spending for the military, veterans\u2019 care, and border security, which means that any cuts to other parts of the budget like education, health care and safety net programs would have to be even deeper to meet the GOP demands of total budget savings.\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that would mean the remaining areas of the budget would have to be slashed dramatically, including the departments of Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Agriculture, among others.\nU.S. spending on defense, meanwhile, has ballooned in recent years under both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2021, Congress pushed Biden to spend nearly $30 billion more on defense than he had requested. The following year, he proposed a further increase, from $780 billion to $813 billion \u2014 yet Congress Hill pushed Biden to ultimately approve $45 billion on top of that, signing a record $858 billion defense budget. This year, the Biden administration is requesting $886 billion in defense spending, a 3% increase that would establish one of the largest peacetime military budgets ever.\nIt\u2019s possible that Biden agrees to some sort of deal with Republicans that freezes future spending at current levels, which the CBO would then score as budget savings, including on defense, because of the growth of inflation.\nBut House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) indicated on Monday that Republicans aren\u2019t willing to discuss freezing spending at current levels, something he called \u201can inherently reasonable position that many in our party might even be uncomfortable with.\u201d\n\u201cHouse Republicans, their proposals haven\u2019t gotten more reasonable,\u201d Jeffries added. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten more extreme.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jared-moskowitz-ron-desantis-gop-primary_n_646c91b1e4b0005c605bd34e": "Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) suggested how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) will take on former President Donald Trump if and when the governor jumps into the 2024 presidential race, which he is expected to do imminently.\nMoskowitz, who joined Congress in January, served as DeSantis\u2019 director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management from 2019 to 2021.\nTalking to CNN\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d show on Monday, Moskowitz described DeSantis as \u201cextremely bright,\u201d detail-oriented and data-driven \u2015 but said he disagreed with many of the extremist policies the governor has pushed in recent months\n\u201cHe\u2019s data-driven, so he\u2019s going to look at the numbers,\u201d Moskowitz said on whether DeSantis will take off the \u201ckid gloves\u201d with which he\u2019s been treating GOP front-runner Trump so far.\nDeSantis will \u201ctest his messages\u201d and figure out \u201cwhat is working and what is not working\u201d before he attacks, he added.\nMoskowitz acknowledged, though, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go take down Donald Trump, you\u2019re going to have to play on his level.\u201d So far, DeSantis has only lightly attacked Trump, likely for fear of offending the former president\u2019s base.\nWith DeSantis and, possibly, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) about to join Trump in the race, Moskowitz warned the GOP primary is \u201cabout to turn into a UFC-WWE fight.\u201d He told people to \u201cbuckle up and strap in because this is going to be something we\u2019ve not seen.\u201d\nWatch the interview here:", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ron-desantis-donald-trump-president_n_646cbd5fe4b06749be16aa11": "The political theorizing of November 2022 had Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis clearing the GOP presidential primary field of non-Donald Trump opposition, setting up a one-on-one slugfest against a former president whose iron grip on the GOP could break following legal problems and electoral losses.\nThe political reality of May 2023 has DeSantis preparing to enter a primary field that is expanding rather than contracting, with Trump back on top in polling and candidates as eager to poach DeSantis\u2019 conservative media hype and big money donors as they are to steal Trump\u2019s grassroots support.\nDeSantis\u2019 official campaign launch is expected in the coming days. Never mind being the only candidate challenging Trump, he won\u2019t be the only candidate to announce a run this week after Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announced a bid on Monday.\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley are also already in the race. Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) could all also launch bids soon.\nAnd potential new candidates are crawling out of the GOP\u2019s political woodwork: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a wealthy former Microsoft executive, has hired political consultants. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose previous presidential endeavors are best summed up by the word \u201coops,\u201d is also considering a bid.\nHopes of isolating Trump one-on-one were a pipe dream, a Republican strategist said, noting the low cost and high potential rewards \u2014 a cabinet slot or Fox News hosting gig \u2014 available to even wildly unsuccessful presidential candidates. DeSantis\u2019 missteps in recent weeks, however, have created openings for other candidates to argue they, rather than DeSantis, are best-positioned to slay the Trump dragon.\n\u201cEverybody who is in the race, is in the race not because of DeSantis, but because of Trump,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican lobbyist and former Capitol Hill aide, who is unaligned in the primary.\nThose candidates either want to block Trump, or are auditioning for a spot on his ticket or in his cabinet, Feehery said.\nBut DeSantis\u2019 \u201cweakness has probably given not only hope but also money to other candidates,\u201d added Feehery, who said he prefers an alternative to Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s been kind of shell-shocked by how quickly Trump has gone after him.\u201d\nWith more than eight months to go until the first 2024 nominating contest, DeSantis is still the Republican most likely to stand between Trump and another presidential nomination. And indeed that is what DeSantis\u2019 team is betting on.\n\u201cThe Republican primary is already a two-man race, and Governor DeSantis isn\u2019t even a candidate,\u201d Erin Perrine, communications director for the pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down, told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cAs we saw at his recent visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, there is growing momentum behind the Governor because he is the only Republican who doesn\u2019t just talk the talk, he follows through on the hard fights like taking on woke corporations.\u201d\n\u201cThe choice couldn\u2019t be clearer for primary voters \u2014 while Donald Trump may talk a big game, DeSantis actually fights and wins,\u201d Perrine added.\nBut each of those lower-tier candidates can chip away at the support DeSantis needs to win in the zero-sum scramble for party delegates.\nThe stakes of candidate competition are especially high on the Republican side, because while Democrats are required to allot convention delegates on a proportional basis, the GOP relies more heavily on winner-take-all \u2014 or winner-take-more \u2014 primary contests.\nIn 2016, for example, the winner-take-all system in Florida helped Trump secure a huge batch of delegates without even winning an outright majority. The outcome prompted Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s departure from the race.\nAhead of his reelection campaign in 2020, Trump encouraged more states to adopt winner-take-all systems, leading to a map where 60% of contests were either winner-take-all from the outset, or become winner-take-all if a candidate surpasses a certain threshold. In theory then, the more Republicans that run in 2024, the harder it becomes for DeSantis to topple Trump.\nA field of mostly longshot candidates polling in the single or low double digits may also help Trump eke out delegate wins without amassing a significant plurality of votes \u2014 or having to broaden his base.\nThe growing field of contenders, Republicans who oppose Trump worry, could lead to a repeat of 2016, when GOP candidates \u2014 fearful of Trump\u2019s base-delighting insults and convinced of his imminent self-implosion \u2014 fought amongst themselves as Trump racked up an eventually insurmountable delegate lead.\n\u201cI was in a 2016 campaign, the \u2018attack the guy who\u2019s a front-runner other than Donald Trump\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019ve tried that,\u201d Sarah Isgur, a former aide to 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIt results in Donald Trump being the nominee.\u201d\nIndeed, scattered polling from the time period when DeSantis was polling best showed him defeating or in close races with Trump when the two were matched up one-on-one. Adding other candidates to the mix, however, typically led to a stronger position for Trump.\nMany of the other contenders seem as or more eager to attack DeSantis than to do battle with Trump. Haley trolled DeSantis over his clashes with Disney earlier this month. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, yet another potential candidate, has both criticized DeSantis\u2019 culture war tactics and insisted he is more fiscally conservative than the Floridian. Christie has said DeSantis\u2019 war with Disney shows the latter man is \u201cnot a conservative\u201d\nAnd DeSantis of course remains Trump\u2019s No. 1 target. Trump has dubbed the Florida governor \u201cRon DeSanctimonious,\u201d and Make America Great Again PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, has already started running a TV advertisement that employs DeSantis\u2019 reported use of his fingers to eat chocolate pudding as a metaphor for his votes as a U.S. House member to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201cRon DeSantis loves sticking his fingers where they don\u2019t belong \u2013 and we\u2019re not just talking about pudding,\u201d the spot says as an actor dips two fingers into the dessert.\nA second MAGA PAC ad that parodies the kids\u2019 song \u201cOld McDonald Had A Farm,\u201d labels the governor \u201cRon DeSalestax\u201d for raising sales taxes.\nThe attacks on DeSantis have taken a toll on his support among Republican primary voters. He has the backing of about 21% of those voters, down from about 30% in March, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s latest public polling average.\nThe governor\u2019s slide in the polls began after his pre-campaign book tour, where he didn\u2019t always seem at ease doing the heavy retail politicking necessary to win a presidential nomination.\nHe has also struggled to justify his accelerating war with Disney and the slew of new Florida laws being challenged in court on First Amendment grounds. Last month, DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban into law, a move that may either help him against Trump with uber-conservative evangelical voters or hurt him with more moderate Republicans and in the general election.\nHaley trolled DeSantis earlier this month over his escalating clashes with Disney.\n\u201cIf Disney would like to move their hundreds of thousands of jobs to South Carolina and bring the billions of dollars with them, I\u2019ll let them know, I\u2019ll be happy to meet them in South Carolina and introduce them to the governor and the legislature that would welcome it,\u201d she said.\nTo some conservative strategists wary of again nominating Trump, the prospect of GOP candidates training their fire on DeSantis, rather than Trump, brings back unhappy memories of the 2016 GOP primary.\nTo emerge from a crowded primary, DeSantis may also have to make his message less about Trump and more about why he\u2019s a better choice than, say, Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate who\u2019s running a campaign far less centered on culture wars, or Ramaswamy, a relative unknown who has shaken up the race with his stances on the voting age and a merit-based system for immigration.\nAt the same time, lesser-known candidates can make the case that DeSantis\u2019 wave of popularity, set into motion during the coronavirus pandemic, has already crested.\nEven some conservatives who believe that DeSantis would be better than Trump and a more effective tribune for right-wing populism acknowledge that a national campaign is uncharted terrain for him.\n\u201cDeSantis has to break out of the Florida bubble and address what he would do for the country as a national leader. That\u2019s been a missing part of this conversation thus far,\u201d said Ryan Girdusky, a conservative consultant associated with the more nationalist wing of the Republican Party. \u201cYou can\u2019t plant palm trees in Michigan or Wisconsin. You need to actually tell me what you\u2019re going to do for Michigan or Wisconsin.\u201d\nGirdusky encouraged DeSantis and other candidates to attack Trump from the right by faulting him for, among other things, failing to complete the border wall or stem the tide of unauthorized immigration.\n\u201cDonald Trump is like Philip Morris cigarettes in the 1960s and 70s,\u201d said Girdusky, who founded The 1776 Project, a right-wing super PAC active in local school board elections. \u201cIt\u2019s a great brand that will give you cancer, but people still like the brand. So you need to destroy the brand.\u201d\nEven in a crowded field, DeSantis can still easily trample his opponents in fundraising and will enter the race with a relatively blank slate to a national audience, said Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe.\n\u201cWhat most people know about DeSantis is COVID and Disney. There\u2019s a lot more to Ron DeSantis,\u201d said Roe, a former senior adviser to Rubio. The other candidates are \u201cnot combative, they\u2019re not pugnacious, and they\u2019re not going to bring the same feistiness to the campaign that Ron DeSantis does.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tim-scott-says-wont-undo-2024-election_n_646c8919e4b056fd46dc4074": "Newly declared Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott said he wouldn\u2019t seek to undo the democratic result of an election he lost, but stopped short of criticizing Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to do so in 2020.\nScott, the only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate, made the comments in an interview with NBC News on Monday, shortly after he announced his White House bid in his home state of South Carolina.\nScott is joining a crowded field seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, including current the front-runner, former President Donald Trump. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) is also expected to join the race this week.\nWhile Scott told NBC News he wouldn\u2019t try to overturn his loss in an election, he did not want to get drawn into discussing Trump\u2019s bid to stay in power after he was defeated by Joe Biden in 2020.\nAsked to assess Trump\u2019s behavior following the 2020 race leading up the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Scott, who was inside the U.S. Capitol during the attack, replied: \u201cWe can do two things here: We can have a conversation about President Trump or we can have a conversation about my vision for the future.\u201d\nTrump on Truth Social welcomed Scott\u2019s candidacy, wishing the senator \u201cgood luck.\u201d\n\u201cIt is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable,\u201d Trump wrote, taking a jab at DeSantis, who for now appears to be his biggest prospective rival.\nBut Scott seemed unfazed by Trump\u2019s apparent dismissal of his candidacy.\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate his vote as well,\u201d Scott said of the former president.\nDuring the interview, Scott touted his anti-abortion credentials, telling NBC\u2019s Tom Llamas that \u201cas president of the United States I would sign the most conservative legislation, pro life legislation that can get to my desk.\u201d He did not explicitly say whether he would support a federal abortion ban.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see legislation like that come through Congress if we don\u2019t first win the hearts and minds of the American people,\u201d he said.\nScott has previously said he backs a 20-week federal abortion ban and would sign it into law if he were elected president.\nThis comes as Republicans have been trying to pass laws to restrict the medical procedure following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v.

Don\u2019t give up on us,\u201d he admonished reporters at the U.S. Capitol early Monday night.\nMcCarthy had his third face-to-face meeting with President Joe Biden in less than two weeks as the White House and congressional Republicans try to navigate a path to avoid defaulting on the government\u2019s AAA-rated debt or leaving other bills unpaid because the Treasury Department runs out of borrowing room.\nDefaulting on the debt or other obligations would lead to an economic crisis, economists say, given the U.S.\u2019s pristine creditworthiness and the role of the dollar in the global economy. Republicans want to force spending cuts and other policy changes in exchange for agreeing to lift the debt limit.\nBut finding common ground has been difficult. The White House says its budget plan issued in March would cut the 10-year deficit by about $3 trillion through a combination of spending cuts and tax hikes. But there has been no vote on that budget plan.\nHouse Republicans narrowly passed a debt limit bill that would cut the deficit on net by about $4.8 trillion over 11 years. But it would get to that number through stringent budget caps that would make annual spending bills for federal agencies very difficult to pass. Several Republicans said the bill was meant as an opening bid, not a final offer.\nThe gap has been difficult to bridge and has only become more difficult as the clock ticks closer to early June, which is when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the risk of default arises. Default could happen as early as June 1, she said again in a letter to lawmakers on Monday.\nA nongovernmental group, the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, said Tuesday June 2 through June 13 posed an \u201celevated risk\u201d of the Treasury running short.\n\u201cCome early June, Treasury will be skating on very thin ice that will only get thinner with each passing day,\u201d said Shai Akabas, executive director of BPC\u2019s economic policy program. \u201cOf course, the problem with skating on thin ice is that sometimes you fall through.\u201d\nMcCarthy was asked why he was upbeat, especially after one of his lieutenants who attended the meeting, Rep.

It is a day where we are standing up and protecting our kids so that they can have a better and brighter future,\u201d Pillen proclaimed in a statement, calling the bill\u2019s passage \u201cthe most significant win for social conservatives in a generation.\u201d\nThe bill as originally written focused on prohibiting transgender people under 19 from having any gender confirmation surgeries. Though Republican lawmakers and conservative media have been raising alarms about such surgeries on minors, they are extremely uncommon. The bill also gives the state\u2019s chief medical officer \u2014 who is neither an elected official nor a specialist in transgender health care \u2015 the power to set regulations on the use of any puberty blockers or hormone treatments for that age group.\nBut after an attempt at a six-week abortion ban failed in the legislature, Republicans added an amendment to the transgender health care bill banning abortion at 12 weeks \u2015 infuriating Democrats who slammed it as an abuse of the legislative process.\nAt Friday\u2019s final debate on the matter, opponents of the abortion ban accused its supporters of quickly tacking on the amendment without a proper hearing and violating rules about combining unrelated matters onto one bill.\n\u201cThe reason the abortion part was added was because the transgender part could not pass without it ... and clearly the abortion bill couldn\u2019t pass without the trans bill, because we had to bring it back to life.

Wade falling.\nBut some of the bill\u2019s supporters said Friday they wish the abortion ban could have been more restrictive.\n\u201cMany of us feel that the six-week \u2018heartbeat\u2019 bill was the answer,\u201d state Sen.

Don\u2019t Pretend It Doesn\u2019t Matter,\u2019\u201d said the show\u2019s host, Ashley Strohmier, referring to a piece last week by conservative columnist Jim Geraghty. \u201cSo do you think that because of your investigation, that is what\u2019s moved this needle with the media?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Comer replied. \u201cYou look at the polling, and right now Donald Trump is 7 points ahead of Joe Biden and trending upward, Joe Biden\u2019s trending downward. And I believe that the media is looking around, scratching their head, and they\u2019re realizing that the American people are keeping up with our investigation.\u201d\nComer\u2019s apparent moment of candor is reminiscent of Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s memorable gaffe in 2015, when he admitted the GOP\u2019s Benghazi committee was created to hurt Hillary Clinton in the polls ahead of the 2016 election, as opposed to being any kind of substantive investigation.\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee \u2015 what are her numbers today?\u201d McCarthy told Fox News at the time. \u201cHer numbers are dropping, why? Because she\u2019s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a video clip of Comer\u2019s seeming slip-up:\nDuring Monday\u2019s interview, Comer claimed that Biden\u2019s family members have received money from foreign nationals, saying \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019ve proven\u201d with the GOP\u2019s probe.\nBut in reality, despite House Republicans\u2019 efforts to portray Biden as hopelessly corrupt, the committee didn\u2019t present any evidence in its hearings that directly implicated Biden.\nComer also misrepresented the state of presidential polling in his interview. His claim that Trump has a 7-point edge over Biden stems from an ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month. Other surveys, however, show Biden leading, and the overall polling picture indicates a tight race between Biden and Trump.\nIn particular, polling shows little indication that House GOP investigations of Biden\u2019s family are driving the president\u2019s political standing downward. While Biden\u2019s approval rating remains underwater, scattered surveys of the public show little indication that the Comer-led investigations have had a major effect one way or another.\nSurveys from earlier this year, conducted by both nonpartisan and Democratic firms, found that most voters thought Republicans were putting too much effort into investigating the president.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tom-carper-senate-2024_n_646b6be1e4b0005c605acf74": "Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware won\u2019t seek reelection in 2024, opening up another seat Democrats will need to defend if they are to maintain their Senate majority next year.\nThe 76-year-old Democrat has been in public office for decades. He began his career as state treasurer in 1976, followed by a stint in the House of Representatives, and then as governor for eight years before entering the Senate in 2001.\nCarper rose quickly in the upper chamber to chair the Homeland Security Committee and later the Environment and Public Works Committee. He was involved in drafting the climate provisions of President Joe Biden\u2019s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act.\nCarper fended off a progressive primary challenger during his 2018 race for reelection, easily beating 38-year-old Air Force veteran and community organizer Kerri Evelyn Harris.\nRep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) is the favorite to replace Carper in the Senate. The 61-year-old lawmaker, who was elected to the House in 2016, served as Biden\u2019s presidential national campaign co-chair in 2020.\nCarper said that Blunt Rochester indicated to him on Monday prior to his announcement that she planned to run for his Senate seat.\n\u201cI said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been patient, waiting for me to get out of the way \u2026 and I hope you run and I hope you\u2019ll let me support you,\u201d Carper said at an event in Wilmington, recounting their conversation. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ll let you support me.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that Democrats elect multiple Black women to the Senate next year in addition to Blunt Rochester.

The incident remains Texas\u2019 deadliest school shooting of all time, and reignited nationwide anger over gun violence and lax firearm regulations.\nThe president delivered a speech on the somber anniversary as first lady Jill Biden looked on, with the two surrounded by 21 white candles bearing the names of the victims.\n\u201cStanding there in Uvalde, Jill and I couldn\u2019t help but think that too many schools, too many everyday places, have become killing fields in communities all across every part of America,\u201d Biden said, recalling his visit to the border town a year earlier. \u201cIn each place, we hear the same message: \u2018Do something. For God\u2019s sake, please do something.\u2019\u201d\nLaw enforcement came under severe criticism for its response to the shooting. A report by Texas lawmakers revealed that nearly 400 heavily armed officers from federal, state and local agencies were on the scene, but that they waited more than an hour before confronting and killing the gunman. Officers also prevented parents who gathered by the school from retrieving their children inside, and at times got physical with them for expressing anger at authorities\u2019 inaction.\nCurrently, a state-level criminal probe into the hesitant police response is still ongoing, and Uvalde authorities continue to withhold public records related to the shooting. Some Uvalde families have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers and law enforcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to act. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard \u2014 not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as friends, as neighbors, as parents, and as fellow Americans,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBecause today, guns remain the number-one killer \u2014 the number-one killer \u2014 of children in America.\u201d\nA month after the tragedy, Biden had signed the country\u2019s most sweeping gun safety bill in decades, which included stricter background checks.\nBut the president this week renewed his calls for lawmakers to pass legislation that permanently bans AR-style firearms and high-capacity magazines, establishes universal background checks and a national \u201cred flag\u201d law, requires safe storage of firearms, and ends gun manufacturers\u2019 immunity from liability.\n\u201cHow many more parents will live their worst nightmare before we stand up to the gun lobby?\u201d Biden said.\nThe president and supporters of gun safety reforms \u2014 including Uvalde parents \u2014 have tried multiple times to advance such proposals, only for conservative legislators to block them.

GOP Gov.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted Monday that Yellen was \u201cfearmongering\u201d and that there was no need to act by June 1.\n\u201cThis is all rhetoric driven. There\u2019s some amounts of reality to it, but there\u2019s also a tremendous amount of narrative building, which Janet Yellen is doing with Joe Biden,\u201d Biggs said in an interview with former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon.\nBiggs is part of a group of House Republicans seen as unlikely to ever vote for a debt ceiling increase, no matter what sort of deal is negotiated with the White House.\nIn April, he told HuffPost, \u201cMy position is that you don\u2019t have to raise the debt ceiling if you bring your spending under control.\u201d\nAnother factor muddying the waters is that the Treasury would like to be able to hold out until mid-June, when quarterly tax payments are due, which could enable it to get to the end of June. By then, a new slate of accounting moves would be available that could allow the Treasury to keep borrowing until the end of July.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some amounts of reality to it, but there\u2019s also a tremendous amount of narrative building, which Janet Yellen is doing with Joe Biden.\u201d\nThat could explain why the Treasury has, according to Washington Post reporting, asked agency budget staffers whether they could delay payments due before early June. Effectively, it would be equivalent to finding change in the couch cushions to make it to the next payday.\nSeveral private sector debt-watchers think the Treasury will likely be able to scrape by through June, but only barely, and with margins so thin that they would raise the chance of an accidental default to a dangerous level. The Bipartisan Policy Center, for example, said on Tuesday that the period of June 2 through June 13 posed an \u201celevated risk\u201d of default.\nYellen\u2019s challenge is how to be prudent \u2014 and warn when the Treasury is getting unacceptably close to default even when it will most likely be able to pay bills \u2014 without seeming to cry \u201cwolf!\u201d as some Republicans are accusing her of doing.\nThe panel of private sector advisers to the Treasury on debt management, the Borrowing Advisory Committee, warned Treasury on May 2 that it already had an inadequate margin for error with only $238 billion in cash on hand, \u201csignificantly below what even the nation\u2019s largest banks hold in available liquidity despite managing significantly smaller balance sheets.\u201d\nAs of Friday, the Treasury had only $60.7 billion on hand.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) defended Yellen, though, when asked about June 1.\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to Janet Yellen,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cThey decide when that date is.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we took action all the way back in April, even before she said it was June 1. We thought it was in July. We don\u2019t want to do this last minute.\u201d\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the Democratic leader in the House, also defended Yellen while taking a swipe at Republicans.\n\u201cThe June 1 date is a real one. Secretary Yellen continues to make that clear,\u201d Jeffries told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\u201cUnfortunately, extreme MAGA Republicans are taking us down the dangerous road of default, for ideological reasons.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-debt-limit_n_6466619ee4b06749be125fbd": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Congressional Democrats are watching anxiously from the sidelines as President Joe Biden negotiates with House Republicans on a budget deal that would avoid a harmful default on the nation\u2019s debt early next month.\nBiden has expressed openness to the idea of paring back some federal safety net programs, and his allies have acknowledged they will need to make concessions in order to reach an agreement by June 1, the projected date the U.S. is expected to no longer be able to meet its obligations.\nThe fact that Biden is even in the position of having to negotiate with Republicans over the debt ceiling, something they lifted three times under former President Donald Trump without any fuss, has left progressive lawmakers fuming.\n\u201cIf Democrats cave to the GOP on work requirements, 1.7 million poor people could lose their healthcare and 275,000 could go hungry. That\u2019s what is at stake. We must stand firm,\u201d tweeted Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) on Thursday, referring to a key GOP demand to add stricter \u201cwork requirements\u201d to federal programs that help low-income Americans afford food and health care.\nIn further sign of angst on the left, 11 Senate Democrats sent a letter to Biden on Thursday urging him to prepare to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally by invoking the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that the public debt \u201cshall not be questioned.\u201d The theory behind their argument is untested and would likely be challenged in the courts, however.\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 unwillingness to consider one penny in new revenue from the wealthy and large corporations, along with their diminishment of the disastrous consequences of default have made it seemingly impossible to enact a bipartisan budget deal at this time,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter, questioning House Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s (R-Calif.) ability to pass a deal should one emerge in the coming days.\nBut there\u2019s rising discontent on the right about the direction of the talks, as well.\nOn Thursday, the House Freedom Caucus, a group of dozens of hardline conservatives, called for an end to negotiations and for the Senate to simply approve the House GOP\u2019s bill that raised the debt ceiling and sharply slashing spending over the next decade. Their stance implied that they won\u2019t support any bipartisan agreement.\n\u201cNo more discussion on watering it down. Period,\u201d the group warned in a statement.\n\u201cThe last thing we need is a repeat of the 2013 deal. It was a terrible deal for the country. I hope we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that the urgent warnings from the left and the right this week are a sign that negotiations between Biden and McCarthy are making progress, and that perhaps a deal is close to materializing. Still, neither side is likely to support an agreement, and their votes may not be ultimately needed to pass one.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has insisted for months that Republicans agree to a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling increase that would take default off the table with no strings attached, before negotiating over the budget later this year. On Thursday, however, he said that the only path forward is a bipartisan agreement.\n\u201cNo one will get everything they want,\u201d Schumer cautioned.\nDemocrats haven\u2019t always loved Biden\u2019s deals with Republicans, despite his successful track record as president. During a 2019 presidential primary debate, for example, Biden was criticized by Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) for making a \u201cterrible deal\u201d with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that staved off a debt default in 2012. As vice president, BIden helped negotiate an agreement that made the bulk of George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts permanent.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope not,\u201d Bennet told HuffPost on Thursday when asked if he worried about Biden agreeing to a similar deal this time around.\n\u201cThe last thing we need is a repeat of the 2013 deal. It was a terrible deal for the country. I hope we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes,\u201d he added.\nMcCarthy claimed one early victory over Democrats this week, bragging that he had gotten them to back off against their stance of not negotiating over the debt limit.\n\u201cThe president and Leader Schumer have finally backed off their idea that they won\u2019t negotiate,\u201d McCarthy declared at a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cThey finally backed off the insane, un-rational, un-sensible idea that you just raise the debt ceiling.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eugene-robinson-ron-desantis_n_646c734be4b0005c605baa04": "Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson predicted that Florida Gov.

At a \u201ctown hall\u201d sponsored for him by CNN earlier this month, Trump repeatedly claimed that he completed his project.\n\u201cI did finish the wall. I built a wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then I said, we have to build some more because there are areas like water going through a dam. There are some areas where a lot of people are coming. You close up one and they come into another. And we started another 100 miles of wall.\u201d\nIt was unclear how, if he had \u201cfinished\u201d a border wall, migrants would nevertheless be coming in \u201clike water going through a dam.\u201d\nIn any event, his claim that he had kept his 2016 campaign promise is untrue on multiple levels.\nFrom the time he announced his run at his Trump Tower building in Manhattan in June 2015, Trump\u2019s favorite promise for his followers was that he would not only build a wall, but force Mexico to pay for it.\n\u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump said in in his announcement speech. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d\nTrump on several occasions went into great detail on the construction standards, describing how it would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent people from tunneling beneath it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it\u2019s going to be made out of rebar. That\u2019s steel,\u201d Trump said at a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, in response to a question from a young boy in the audience. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to set it in nice, heavy foundations.\u201d\nOf equal importance in the promise was to force Mexico to pay, both as a way to humiliate the nation\u2019s neighbor to the south as well as a pledge to voters not to use American taxpayer dollars on the project.\nBut both elements of the promise began to crumble soon after he took office. Within weeks, Trump spoke to then-Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and told him he had no intention of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, but that he needed Pe\u00f1a not to mention that publicly so Trump would not anger his supporters. \u201cYou cannot say that to the press,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cIf you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.\u201d\nAnd even though both the House and Senate were controlled by Republicans during his first two years, Trump made virtually no effort in that time to press for border wall funding. Instead, the Department of Homeland Security stayed with a program started under Republican President George W. Bush and continued under Democrat Barack Obama to replace deteriorating sections of old fencing with new, 18- to 30-foot steel bollards.\nIndeed, Trump did not get serious about winning congressional funding for his wall until after Democrats won back the House in 2018 after picking up dozens of seats, thanks to Trump\u2019s unpopularity. Trump forced a partial government shutdown in an attempt to win wall funding, but eventually gave up and decided to raid the military\u2019s construction budget, diverting billions of dollars intended for housing, schools and daycare for service members and their families to his border wall instead.\nBy the end of his four years in office, Trump delivered all of 52 miles of new fence where no barrier had previously existed \u2014 a far cry from his original promise of a \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d along the entirely of the 1,954-mile southern border. An additional 400 miles of older, existing barrier was replaced with the new, taller steel bollard fencing \u2014 just as old barrier had been replaced over the previous two presidencies.\n\u201cNot only couldn\u2019t he get Mexico to pay for it, he couldn\u2019t get a Republican Congress to pay for it,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a former top aide in Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 bid for the GOP nomination.\nBut despite Trump\u2019s easily proven failure to deliver on his top campaign promise over the course of four years, most of his GOP rivals \u2014 all of whom say the United States must get tougher on border security \u2014 thus far do not seem inclined to point out Trump\u2019s record on the matter.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, on March 30 said at a Georgia visit: \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot, but I think we need to get serious and finally build a wall along the southern border\u201d \u2014 but did not mention the obvious point that the front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination failed to build one.\nAn adviser to one of the GOP hopefuls, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said attacking Trump on the border wall would be difficult because voters understand that he wanted to build one but that he could not overcome the obstacles placed in his way. \u201cThere are better attacks,\u201d the aide said, pointing to Trump\u2019s recent comments disparaging anti-abortion activists and his inability to control government spending.\nThe only candidate or likely candidate to attack Trump on the wall appears to be former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \u201cMore nonsense from Donald Trump last night,\u201d Christie wrote in a social media post the morning after the CNN town hall. \u201cFact: He promised to build a big beautiful wall on the border. Fact: He did not deliver & immigrants are pouring over the border. Fact: He said Mexico would pay for it. Fact: We have not gotten one peso yet. He failed us on immigration.\u201d\nTrump critics, including former Republican officials, said other candidates are not likely to criticize Trump so directly unless and until Republican primary voters signal that they are no longer willing to accept Trump\u2019s falsehoods.\n\u201cThe truth is, GOP primary voters have already made it clear that they don\u2019t care about his lies. They will stand with him till the end,\u201d Horn said.\nDavid Axelrod, a Democratic consultant who helped Obama win the White House in 2008, said the loyalty of Trump\u2019s base continues to confound him. \u201cThe man has been indicted, found liable for sexual assault and defamation and is clearly in the crosshairs of other probes, and he has only gained ground in recent months,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cTo his base, it may be that if he says there\u2019s a wall, there\u2019s a wall \u2014 and anyone who suggests otherwise is engaged in \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d\nTrump, who tried to use the threat of violence and then actual violence on Jan. 6, 2021, to remain in power despite losing reelection, is under criminal investigation for his post-election actions by prosecutors in both Georgia and at the Department of Justice. He is separately under DOJ investigation for his refusal to turn over top-secret documents he had been keeping at his Florida country club in defiance of a subpoena, and has already been indicted in New York City for falsifying business records in his attempt to hide a $130,000 payment to a porn star in the days ahead of the 2016 election.

Garret Graves of Louisiana, speaking alongside McCarthy at the Capitol, said the numbers \u201care the foundation\u201d of any agreement.\nRepublicans also want work requirements on the Medicaid health care program, though the Biden administration has countered that millions of people could lose coverage. The GOP additionally introduced new cuts to food aid by restricting states\u2019 ability to waive work requirements in places with high joblessness. That idea, when floated under President Donald Trump, was estimated to cause 700,000 people to lose their food benefits.\nGOP lawmakers are also seeking cuts in IRS money and, by sparing Defense and Veterans accounts from reductions, would shift the bulk of spending reductions to other federal programs.\nThe White House has countered by keeping defense and nondefense spending flat next year, which would save $90 billion in the 2024 budget year and $1 trillion over 10 years.\nAll sides have been eyeing the potential for the package to include a framework that would speed energy project developments.\nAnd despite a push by Republicans for the White House to accept parts of their proposed immigration overhaul, McCarthy indicated the focus was on the House\u2019s previously approved debt and budget package.\n\u201cI think that we can reach an agreement,\u201d Biden said, though he added this about Republicans: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t force a default by doing something outrageous.\u201d\nRepublicans had also rejected various White House revenue proposals. Among the proposals the GOP objects to are policies that would enable Medicare to pay less for prescription drugs. Republicans also have refused to roll back Trump-era tax breaks on corporations and wealthy households as Biden\u2019s own budget has proposed.\nBiden, nonetheless, insisted that \u201crevenue is not off the table.\u201d\nFor months, Biden had refused to engage in talks over the debt limit, contending that Republicans in Congress were trying to use the borrowing limit vote as leverage to extract administration concessions on other policy priorities.\nBut with the June 1 potential deadline looming and Republicans putting their own legislation on the table, the White House launched talks on a budget deal that could accompany an increase in the debt limit.\nBiden\u2019s decision to set up a call with McCarthy came after another start-stop day with no outward signs of progress.\nThe president tried to assure leaders attending the meeting of the world\u2019s most powerful democracies that the United States would not default. U.S. officials said leaders were concerned, but largely confident that Biden and American lawmakers would resolve the crisis.\nThe president, though, said he was ruling out the possibility of taking action on his own to avoid a default. Any such steps, including suggestions to invoke the 14th Amendment as a solution, would become tied up in the courts.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question that I think is unresolved,\u201d Biden said, adding he hopes to try to get the judiciary to weigh in on the notion for the future.\n___\nMiller and Boak reported from Hiroshima, Japan.

His comments Saturday provided additional context for the decision.\nIn a statement responding to Parlatore\u2019s comments, a Trump spokesman said \u201cMr. Parlatore is no longer a member of the legal team. His statements regarding current members of the legal team are unfounded and categorically false.\u201d\nIn his interview, Parlatore said Epshteyn had served as a \u201cfilter\u201d in preventing the legal team from getting information about the investigation to or from Trump.\nHe also said Epshteyn had resisted the idea of the legal team organizing months ago a search of Trump\u2019s property in Bedminster, New Jersey, for potential additional classified documents, and that he had impeded a defense strategy aimed at helping \u201ceducate (Attorney General) Merrick Garland as to how best to handle this matter.\u201d Parlatore was one of the authors of a letter last month to the chairman of the House intelligence committee laying out a series of potential defenses in the investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult enough fighting against DOJ, and in this case a special counsel, but when you also have people within the tent that are also trying to undermine you, block you and really make it so that I can\u2019t do what I know that I need to do as a lawyer,\u201d Parlatore said.\n\u201cAnd when I am getting into fights like that, that\u2019s detracting from what is necessary to defend the client and ultimately was not in the client\u2019s best interest, so I made the decision to withdraw,\u201d he added.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-republicans-dodge-george-santos-expulsion-vote_n_6467e52fe4b0ab2b97e78029": "Several House Republicans from swing seats in New York said there\u2019s not enough votes to kick fraudster Rep. George Santos out of Congress \u2015 after they blocked a vote that would have put exactly that question to the test.\nThese five New York Republicans \u2014 Reps. Mike Lawler, Anthony D\u2019Esposito, Nicholas LaLota, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams \u2014 joined the rest of their party in preventing an up-or-down vote on the expulsion of Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), despite repeatedly calling for him to leave office.\nTheir justification? Given the need for a two-thirds majority to expel any member of the House, Santos\u2019 expulsion wouldn\u2019t have passed an up-or-down vote anyway.\n\u201cSince we don\u2019t yet have the needed 2/3 supermajority to expel Santos, the quickest way to rid this institution of this stain is to refer this issue to the House Ethics Committee,\u201d D\u2019Esposito said in a Wednesday statement, after leading the charge for an Ethics Committee referral.\nHere\u2019s how it happened: In response to California Rep. Robert Garcia\u2019s introduction of a resolution to expel Santos, House Republicans instead passed a motion to refer the matter of Santos\u2019 expulsion to the House Ethics Committee.\nAll 221 House Republicans, who participated in the vote, voted in favor of the motion\u2019s passage.\nWhile Republicans involved in the effort depicted it as a matter of adhering to proper protocol \u2014 or, as in the case of the New York members, pragmatism \u2014 their action amounted to punting on the expulsion indefinitely.\nThe bipartisan House Ethics Committee has already been investigating Santos since March. And the Department of Justice, which earlier this month charged Santos with 13 fraud and theft-related crimes, has reportedly instructed the House panel to stand down and allow federal prosecutors to take precedence.\nInstead, House Democrats maintain that their GOP counterparts are simply keen to avoid prompting a special election that would, at the very least, create a temporary vacancy that would jeopardize their ability to pass party-line legislation. Republicans have nine more seats than Democrats in the House, but the routine defection of far-right members of the House Republican Conference has given them even less wiggle room on close votes.\n\u201cThis was an effort to bury accountability for a serious fraudster,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said at a Thursday press conference. \u201cWhy? Perhaps it\u2019s because extreme MAGA Republicans need George Santos\u2019 vote.\u201d\nWhatever House Republicans\u2019 motive, their successful tabling of a Santos expulsion effort puts five New York Republicans in purple House districts in a tight spot.\nThose members have been among the most outspoken voices condemning Santos and calling for his exit, either through resignation or expulsion.\nD\u2019Esposito, who flipped a Democratic-held Long Island seat in November, was the first House Republican to call on Santos to resign.\nAsked how he reconciled his decision to vote against an expulsion vote with his previous calls for Santos\u2019 resignation, D\u2019Esposito\u2019s office referred HuffPost to the Congress member\u2019s Wednesday statement affirming that he wished to expel Santos but that there is not yet a two-thirds majority in the House needed to expel him. In that statement, he also described Santos as a \u201cdisgusting liar.\u201d\nLaLota, also a Long Island Republican, called for Santos to resign shortly after D\u2019Esposito did, and went on to endorse his expulsion in late February.\nAsked to explain Wednesday\u2019s vote, a spokesperson for LaLota referred HuffPost to his statement from that day.\n\u201cIf the Democrats were serious about his expulsion, they would work with us to get a report and referral from the Ethics Committee, rather than offer a political resolution that has no chance of passing the House.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I would have preferred there to be enough votes to expel the sociopath scam artist, Congressman D\u2019Esposito has spearheaded the next best option: To refer this matter to the Ethics Committee where we expect a result within 60 days and for the terrible liar to be gone, by resignation or expulsion, before August recess,\u201d LaLota said.\nRep. Marc Molinaro, who represents a district stretching from the upper Hudson Valley to the Finger Lakes region, was perhaps the first New York Republican to say he would support Santos\u2019 expulsion in early February, a position he reiterated in March.\nMolinaro also based his vote on an understanding that the House lacked the two-thirds majority needed for expulsion, according to a spokesperson, who also shared a statement with HuffPost.\n\u201cGeorge Santos should not be a Member of Congress. He has irrevocably lost the trust of his constituents and colleagues,\u201d Molinaro said. \u201cI expect the Ethics Committee to conduct an immediate and swift review.\u201d\nLawler, a lower Hudson Valley lawmaker who ousted then-Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Chair Sean Patrick Maloney in November, has repeatedly demanded Santos\u2019 resignation.\nAfter voting for the motion to send Santos\u2019 expulsion to the House Ethics Committee, Lawler accused Democrats of playing politics.\n\u201cIf the Democrats were serious about his expulsion, they would work with us to get a report and referral from the Ethics Committee, rather than offer a political resolution that has no chance of passing the House,\u201d he said in a Wednesday statement.\nFinally, Rep. Brandon Williams of central New York has more than once called for Santos to resign. Williams represents a seat long held by the GOP, but where President Joe Biden won in 2020.\nHuffPost did not receive an immediate response from a Williams spokesperson about his vote to send Santos\u2019 expulsion to committee.\nRegardless of these Republicans\u2019 explanations, House Democrats see an opportunity to inflict damage on five of the Republicans they are hoping to unseat in 2024.\nThe DCCC, House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, announced Friday that it was spending thousands of dollars on a small digital advertising campaign blasting the five New York Republicans for their vote. (A second ad blitz is due to target House Republicans in 14 other states.)\n\u201cVulnerable House Republicans have proven they are too weak to buck party leadership and \u2014 instead of expelling serial grifter and indicted criminal George Santos from Congress \u2014 they are protecting him,\u201d DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton said in a statement.\nJonathan Nicholson contributed reporting.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/debt-ceiling-negotiations-pause_n_6467ad1ce4b056fd46d97102": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The lead Republicans negotiating a debt ceiling deal with the White House walked out of the talks on Friday morning, saying Republicans needed to \u201cpress pause,\u201d but returned hours later.\n\u201cUntil people are willing to have reasonable conversations about how you can actually move forward and do the right thing, then we\u2019re not going to sit here and talk to ourselves,\u201d Rep.

A default would be unprecedented and have big economic repercussions because the entire financial system benchmarks borrowing costs to the interest rates on presumably reliable government debt.\nMcCarthy and President Joe Biden sounded optimistic this week that they were making progress on a deal, prompting progressive Democrats to sound alarms about potential benefit cuts.\nFar-right Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus, meanwhile, called for McCarthy to cease negotiations, which did actually happen for several hours on Friday. Former President Donald Trump urged Republicans on Friday not to make a deal \u201cunless they get everything they want.\u201d\nBiden has signaled openness to new work requirements \u2015 better understood as limits on benefits to the unemployed \u2015 but it\u2019s unclear where he might be willing to add them.
