{"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mistakes-booking-hotel-travel_l_64553897e4b0452cee9d571f": "Staying at a hotel is such a common part of the travel experience that you\u2019d think the process is foolproof. Still, plenty of people make mistakes \u2015 and sometimes end up paying handsomely \u2015 when it comes to booking their travel accommodations.\nWhether these missteps end up costing valuable time and money or otherwise just sour the vacation experience, it\u2019s worth taking the time to steer clear of such hassle. That\u2019s why HuffPost asked some experts to share the common mistakes travelers make when it comes to booking a hotel.\nFrom selecting the wrong cancellation policy to grossly underestimating final costs, here are 12 hotel booking errors \u2015 and some advice for avoiding them in your future travels.\nChoosing A Hotel Solely Based On Price\n\u201cWhile it may be tempting, do not just book the cheapest hotel,\u201d said Phil Dengler, co-founder of The Vacationer. \u201cBefore picking a hotel, you need to read reviews from a variety of different sources.\u201d\nRemember there might be a good reason why the option is so cheap, whether it\u2019s poorly reviewed or inconveniently located.\n\u201cYou need to check its location on Google Maps and decide if it is a good spot for your home base,\u201d Dengler noted.\nKonrad Waliszewski, the CEO of the booking deals resource @hotel, believes that travelers often underestimate the importance of optimizing for location.\n\u201cSaving a few bucks by staying further away from your preferred neighborhoods and activities may seem tempting at first, but it can result in frustration and increased time and money spent on transportation during your trip,\u201d he said. \u201cPrioritize convenience and proximity to your desired destinations when choosing your hotel.\u201d\nForgetting To Take Resort Fees Into Account\n\u201cUnfortunately, hotel websites as well as third-party booking sites often hide resort fees until the very last second,\u201d Dengler said. \u201cBy the time they show, many people have already filled out their personal and payment information.\u201d\nHe recommended searching for resort fee information before you start the actual booking process. That way you get a better sense of how much you\u2019ll actually be paying per night.\n\u201cOn third-party booking sites, you can often find them listed toward the bottom of the listing,\u201d Dengler explained. \u201cIf you do not see them, just click through to the final booking page. Some hotels charge $40 or more per night in resort fees. That can add up for a multinight stay, and many times you do not get much for paying the required fee.\u201d\nAssuming Parking Is Included\nEven when you\u2019re paying expensive resort fees, parking is not necessarily included in that extra cost.\n\u201cIf you have a car, always check the hotel\u2019s parking situation,\u201d Dengler advised. \u201cSome hotels do not have a parking lot, and you will be forced to find and potentially pay expensive public parking fees. Other hotels do not have self-parking and instead charge hefty valet parking fees. I\u2019ve seen upwards of $60 per day before tip.\u201d\nSelecting The Wrong Cancellation Policy\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes that someone can make when booking a hotel is not checking the cancellation policy,\u201d said Collette Stohler, a travel agent with Elite Travel Arrangements and director of marketing at Roamaroo. \u201cWhile nonrefundable rates may save you a few dollars, the hotel will not refund your money under any circumstance if you need to cancel.\u201d\nAs unexpected changes and delays seem to have become more common than ever, it makes sense to opt for flexible rates just in case. Make sure you correctly understand the timing, however.\n\u201cTravelers typically don\u2019t realize that the cancellation policy deadline of hotels is always set in the local time zone of the hotel,\u201d Waliszewski said. \u201cIf you need to cancel or modify your trip, make sure you do it before the deadline local time. Set a reminder for your cancellation deadline in your calendar to avoid any last-minute surprises.\u201d\nBooking With A Debit Card\n\u201cBesides earning points, credit cards offer purchase protection that cash and debit cards do not,\u201d Dengler said. \u201cI recommend always booking your hotel stays with a credit card. Even no-annual-fee cards like the Chase Freedom Unlimited earn 1.5% cash back for every dollar spent as well as 5% cash back per dollar spent for hotels purchased through Chase.\u201d\n\u201cAdditionally, it offers trip cancellation/interruption insurance, which is great peace of mind when booking hotels,\u201d he added. \u201cOther travel credit cards with annual fees offer even more benefits when booking hotels, but there are many no-annual-fee cards available that are more than enough for most people.\u201d\nIn addition to airline miles, room upgrades and cash-back bonuses, credit card benefits like fraud protection and immediate refunds for incorrect charges offer a lot of comfort when planning a vacation. With a debit card, you may also have to worry about having insufficient funds for any temporary holds the hotel might require upon check-in, which can add up and take time to be refunded.\nUsing A Third-Party Platform Incorrectly\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes people make when booking hotels is not booking directly with the hotel itself and instead using booking engines,\u201d said Victoria Yore, the travel blogger behind Follow Me Away.\nIf you book directly through the Marriott or Hilton website for instance, you can directly contact Marriott or Hilton when something goes wrong and get immediate help.\n\u201cIf you use a booking engine such as Expedia and there is a problem, often the hotel chain cannot help you and you need to use Expedia as a middleman in order to work out the problem with the hotel, instead of going direct,\u201d Yore said. \u201cAs long as you know this upfront when making this choice, you are far more prepared than many others who may be blindsided in the event of an emergency or cancellation.\u201d\nDengler also prefers booking directly with the hotel to cut out the middleman when he has to change or cancel a reservation. He recommended booking directly to guarantee you\u2019ll receive credit toward the hotel\u2019s rewards program and the opportunity to access benefits if you already have status as well.\n\u201cMany hotels guarantee the cheapest price when booking directly through them,\u201d Dengler added. \u201cUnless you have a special promo code at a third-party booking site, I recommend just booking directly with the hotel for special rates and better service.\u201d\nBooking The Wrong Location...\n\u201cI worked in reception of hotels for eight years, and something which happened surprisingly often was a traveler showing up with a reservation for the night, in a hotel of the same name, but in a different country!\u201d said Meg Jerrard, co-founder of Solo Female Travelers. \u201cSo I recommend you always double-check that you\u2019re booking the right location, as many countries, and even cities, have hotels by similar or the same names.\u201d\nBecause 24-hour cancellation policies are the norm for hotels, discovering that you\u2019ve booked the wrong place upon arrival means you\u2019ll be out the money you spent on that incorrect hotel and also have little choice over the room type that\u2019s left at the one where you actually want to stay. Make sure you always confirm the address before embarking on your trip.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an easy mistake if you\u2019re searching for hotels on booking platforms, but then going directly to the hotel site to make a booking,\u201d Jerrard said. \u201cYou can overlook the location when you simply Google a hotel name and click on the first option.\u201d\n...Or The Wrong Dates\n\u201cThe surprisingly most common mistake by far is booking the wrong dates,\u201d Waliszewski said. \u201cAlways double-check your dates before finalizing your reservation. It may sound obvious, but it happens more often than you think.\u201d\nAs with your hotel\u2019s address, just take that extra moment to review your selected dates and make sure they align with your travel plans. Things can get confusing with long-haul overnight flights and major time zone changes.\nOvervaluing Loyalty Programs\nWaliszewski believes that many travelers overvalue hotel loyalty programs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential to know the actual value of your points and status, and be cautious not to spend more money solely to book a room with a specific brand unless it genuinely adds value to your stay,\u201d he said. \u201cTake a step back and evaluate the benefits you\u2019ll receive against the additional cost you might incur.\u201d\nFailing To Plan Ahead\n\u201cA major issue is not devoting enough time to proper planning and not starting the process early enough before the trip,\u201d said Gordon Gurnik, the chief operating officer at Hilton Grand Vacations. \u201cPlanning ahead is critical, because trying to make last-minute accommodations will likely mean sacrificing the perfect trip or more expensive choices\u201d\nThere are a number of theories around the perfect time to book a hotel for the best rate, which can depend on the location and time of year. But Gurnik\u2019s bottom line: Do your research and give yourself as much time as possible to make a decision that ensures your vacation meets your expectations. You can even adopt a \u201creserve now, cancel later\u201d attitude and give yourself flexible options, which is especially helpful if you notice the rates going down as your travel dates approach.\nOverlooking Amenities\n\u201cTo make sure you get the most of your stay, I recommend researching where you want to stay and what kind of amenities are important to you,\u201d Gurnik said \u201cFor example, do you want your hotel to have a pool, a gym or airport pickup? Are your dates flexible? How many beds and rooms do you need to be comfortable?\u201d\nTaking stock of your needs and having answers to these questions makes for a smooth and stress-free vacation. If certain hotel amenities require reservations, try to snag those in advance as well.\n\u201cWith travel at an all-time high, make sure to book any added experiences such as spas, tours and restaurants ahead of time, especially in properties that offer these services to guests outside the property,\u201d said Jessica van Dop DeJesus, founder and editor at The Dining Traveler.\nNot Asking For A Room Upgrade\n\u201cMost travelers overlook the simple step of calling the hotel a day before check-in to confirm their room and inquire about any complimentary upgrades, Waliszewski said. \u201cWhile upgrades aren\u2019t always available, it\u2019s worth the effort as it can really enhance your stay. A quick call allows you to establish a personal connection with the hotel staff and might lead to a pleasant surprise.\u201d\nEven if an upgrade feels like a long shot, it never hurts to just ask.\n\u201cI call the hotel the night before and ask for an upgrade,\u201d Dengler echoed. \u201cIf I am denied, I ask again when checking in. In most cases, you will only be upgraded to the next level room. So do not expect to get the penthouse when you booked the cheapest room.\u201d\nStill, the mere idea of getting some sort of special perk can offer a nice mental boost that makes your vacation even more enjoyable.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eco-friendly-travel-destinations_l_643ad28ce4b0ac40918b6b02": "People choose their travel destinations for a variety of reasons \u2015 costs, itinerary options, proximity to loved ones, social media influence and more. But an increasingly popular factor is sustainability.\n\u201cI believe that not only is green travel becoming more common, but it\u2019s also becoming the overwhelming preference as people are recognizing and standing up to the environmental challenges that impact our lives and economy,\u201d Jack Coble, vice president of design and environmental stewardship at Urban Villages, told HuffPost.\nWherever in the world you are or want to go these days, you\u2019ll likely be able to find a destination that emphasizes sustainability, whether through hyper-local dining and shopping options, accommodations and transportation with a smaller environmental footprint, or activities that focus on conservation.\n\u201cLook for experiences that support environmental literacy and remediation as your activities,\u201d advised Eloisa Lewis, the founder of New Climate Culture.\nShe offered a list of options, including mushroom foraging, native edible plant identification, farm sanctuaries, beekeeping, pottery classes, having fresh air picnics with sustainable ingredients, touring an animal rescue facility, planting native wildflowers, natural dye workshops and visits to regenerative wineries.\n\u201cI would say that green travel really hinges on the idea that you are honoring the locations you are visiting with your presence, taking the responsibility to be an ally to their beauty and health while also exchanging benefits and culture together,\u201d Lewis said.\nAs you choose a destination, make sure to do your research to weed out vendors with a one-dimensional, buzzword-focused approach to sustainability. \u201cGreenwashing\u201d is a real issue across all industries, including travel.\n\u201cInstead, look for hotels that talk about how they\u2019re directly reducing their carbon emissions and how they\u2019re making a positive impact on their surrounding ecosystems and communities,\u201d Coble said. \u201cGiven their commitment to their local environments, these companies will often provide a more authentic experience as well.\u201d\nOf course, sticking closer to home is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint by cutting out the need for air travel, so it\u2019s best to avoid or limit flying when planning a vacation. Visiting a destination during off-season dates can also help ease the burden on the local environment.\nFortunately, there are excellent options all around the world. Whether you\u2019re interested in exploring natural landscapes, learning about sustainability, or supporting conservation efforts, these green travel destinations offer something for everyone.\nCosta Rica\nKevCordero / 500px via Getty Images\n\u201cCosta Rica always has been a leader in eco-tourism,\u201d said Theresa Jackson of Enlightened Journeys Travel\n.\nThe Central American country is known for its commitment to sustainability, with countless environmentally-friendly accommodations and activities for visitors to enjoy while minimizing their ecological footprint. More than a quarter of Costa Rica\u2019s land area is protected as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife refuges.\nNature lovers focused on responsible tourism can participate in sustainable activities like hiking or zip-lining through the country\u2019s lush rainforests, kayaking around mangroves and spotting birds and other exotic creatures.\nSan Francisco\nDon White via Getty Images\n\u201cNaturally, I\u2019m a little biased towards the city of San Francisco, as I greatly admire the extensive eco-friendly initiatives that the city has introduced over the years,\u201d said Ashley Gochnauer, general manager of 1 Hotel San Francisco\n. \u201cThis starts upon guests\u2019 arrival at SFO, which is the first airport in the world to prohibit the sale of single-use plastic or aseptic paper water bottles.\u201d\nShe touted the city\u2019s growing number of parks and clean energy and waste management policies. Visitors seeking an eco-friendly getaway can also appreciate San Francisco\u2019s green building practices, biking and public transportation options and emphasis on locally sourced cuisine.\n\u201cWith its diverse natural ecology and a plethora of national parks, I also see the greater destination of Northern California as one that is bountiful with opportunities for a sustainable stay \u2015 specifically in places like Muir Woods, Wine Country, Big Sur, Lake Tahoe and Mendocino,\u201d Gochnauer added.\nNorway\nRyhor Bruyeu / EyeEm via Getty Images\nNorway\u2019s pristine natural beauty includes glaciers, fjords, mountains, and forests aplenty. Thus, there are ample opportunities for eco-tourism activities like hiking, biking, kayaking and wildlife watching in unique Arctic destinations like the Lofoten Islands and Svalbard.\nThe Scandinavian country is also a leader in renewable energy with its hydropower and wind farm resources that generate more than 90% of the nation\u2019s electricity. Sustainable seafood and energy-efficient hotels also draw environmentally conscious tourists to Norway.\n\u201cHappily, there are so many eco-friendly destinations to choose from, but I\u2019m excited by the electric-powered small ship cruises offered by Hurtigruten in Norway,\u201d said Tom Hall, vice president of Lonely Planet\n.\nNew Zealand\nprimeimages via Getty Images\nAnother country leading the charge in sustainable travel is New Zealand, which has made significant efforts to preserve the beauty of its natural environment. The glaciers, beaches, forests and mountains make it a nature lover's paradise.\nEco-friendly tourism options range from whale watching and wildlife spotting to hiking and kayaking. In addition, educational tours and exhibits help visitors learn about New Zealand's conservation efforts, like its focus on renewable energy.\nSingapore\nTuul & Bruno Morandi via Getty Images\n\u201cSustainable travel is less about where you travel and more about how travel,\u201d said writer and sustainable travel expert Sarah Reid\n. \u201cThat said, some destinations make it easier by offering planet-friendly amenities like clean drinking water, great public transport and alternatives to single-use plastics. As the only entire country that has achieved sustainable destination certification from the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Singapore is an excellent choice!\u201d\nIn Singapore, you\u2019ll find solar-powered gardens, recycled wastewater systems, and other displays of the country and city-state\u2019s support for green initiatives.\nThe Netherlands\nAlexander Spatari via Getty Images\nFor decades, the Netherlands has proven its dedication to environmental protection, making major strides in reducing pollution and carbon emissions, among other green initiatives. It\u2019s one of the most bike-friendly destinations in the world, and there are many great opportunities for cycling tours.\n\u201cRotterdam, Netherlands, is ranked No. 1 in the world for top cities for sustainably-minded travelers thanks to how accessible it is by bike, trains and ferries, and the availability of eco-friendly hotels to name a few,\u201d said Per Christiansen, senior vice president for EMEA and APAC marketing at Kayak.\nPortugal\nStarcevic via Getty Images\nPortugal is home to a number of sustainable travel experiences.

And, as we enter the peak tourism season of summer, countless travelers likely will experience the impact firsthand.\n\u201cStrikes can disrupt vacation travel in several ways,\u201d said Michael Ballard, director of intelligence at the international security firm Global Guardian. \u201cAirport staff, including air traffic controllers, security personnel and baggage handlers, can go on strike, leading to canceled flights, delays with baggage handling and security lines, and lost luggage.\u201d\nAirline pilots also may strike, which means planes cannot fly, Ballard noted. Similarly, there might be mass cancellations of railway and metro services when transit operators walk out.\n\u201cAnti-pension reform protests in France in 2023 led to widespread strikes across labor sectors, including in public transportation,\u201d Ballard explained. \u201cAs a result, many people who use rail, subway, metro or bus services to get to work or otherwise move around were forced to travel by automobile during the strike, leading to significantly increased traffic in Paris and other French cities.\u201d\nStrikes often are accompanied by protests, which can require tourists to further change their plans, Ballard said.\n\u201cMany holidaymakers have already been affected by travel-related strike action this year, with flight delays, train cancellations, and extensive passport renewal times becoming more frequent,\u201d Candee said. \u201cWith this in mind, it pays to be prepared if your plans are impacted.\u201d\nBelow, experts explain how exactly to be prepared and what to do if a strike occurs during a planned trip:\nFind out what you can in advance.\n\u201cThe good news is that strikes are generally announced in advance and are usually limited to a finite time period,\u201d said Zach Griff, senior reporter at The Points Guy.\nAlthough snap strikes may occur, more often there\u2019s a fair bit of planning and communication ahead of time. For example, the British and Irish trade union Unite announced in April that Heathrow Airport staff walkouts were scheduled for May 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10, and May 25, 26 and 27. This gave travelers the opportunity to adjust their itineraries.\n\u201cIf a strike is planned when you\u2019re scheduled to travel, many airlines will offer flexible rebooking policies to let you voluntarily change your plans to avoid any possible disruptions,\u201d Griff explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re traveling with a major airline, you\u2019ll likely have the option of rerouting through a different airport or flying at a different day or time to avoid a strike.\u201d\nPointing to the recent passport office strikes in the U.K., Candee recommended advance planning for those whose documents are expired or about to be.\n\u201cTo avoid any issues associated with passport office strikes, make sure to apply for a passport well in advance of your trip,\u201d Candee said. \u201cCurrently, the U.K. Home Office is working toward a 10-week time scale for general passport renewals. However, this figure could increase as a result of strikes.\u201d\nBuild flexibility into your itinerary.\n\u201cPlan flexible itineraries, book flexible fares, and take advantage of bookings sites that allow you to make multiple bookings for options that you can cancel at the last minute,\u201d said Julian Moro, senior vice president and regional security director at International SOS.\nIndeed, many hotels and rental car companies allow free cancellation until 24 hours before a reservation, so you could book accommodations in more than one destination if you\u2019re worried about anything impacting a long-awaited vacation. For event-related trips like a destination wedding, try to build in extra travel days and options to account for delays.\n\u201cIf you absolutely must travel during a strike, arrive even earlier than you normally would and be prepared for possible disruptions to your journey,\u201d Griff advised. \u201cFlying with major airlines is also a great way to prepare for a possible strike. These mega-carriers typically offer multiple daily flights to a given destination from an assortment of hubs, so you\u2019ll likely have a higher chance of avoiding disruptions with these carriers.\u201c\nHave backup plans.\n\u201cHave a backup plan on how to get to your destination, whether that means taking a car instead of traveling by rail, or a secondary airport to fly into/out of if a strike is planned during your vacation,\u201d Ballard said.\nTaking the time to determine alternative transportation options in advance is incredibly useful, should the primary option disappear.\n\u201cUnderstand the driving license requirements for driving in countries in your itinerary in case you need to drive one or more parts,\u201d Moro said. \u201cKnow where your ride-sharing apps do and don\u2019t work, download any authorized local equivalents in jurisdictions in which ride-sharing is assessed as a legitimate and safe alternative to taxis.\u201d\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for help figuring out these backup options.\n\u201cYou can reach out to your travel agent if you have one to determine alternative means of travel and accommodations or contact the businesses that are going on strike to determine an alternate plan of attack,\u201d Moro said.\nKeep up with the latest news.\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re traveling, be sure to stay up to date on the local news and sign up for travel alerts from your airline,\u201d Griff advised.\nThat way you can take action as soon as possible.\n\u201cWhile most strikes are planned in advance, some can happen unexpectedly,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cLike bad weather, try not to let the inconvenience of a labor strike ruin your vacation. Stay informed. Maintain communication with your airline, travel agent, and hotel.\u201d\nSecurity consultants like Global Guardian offer pre-travel intelligence reports and access to real-time travel alerts as well, Ballard said. You can also discuss an evacuation plan in the event unrest escalates and prompts a \u201cDo Not Travel Advisory\u201d from the U.S. State Department \u2015 as recently happened in Sudan.\n\u201cMonitor official and unofficial local sources,\u201d Moro said. \u201cUnderstand where and when in your itinerary strike action could be prevalent.\u201d\nKnow your refund rights.\n\u201cWhen your flight to, from or within the U.S. is canceled or significantly delayed, you\u2019re entitled to a full refund,\u201d Griff said. \u201cIf a strike disrupts your trip, you may have better luck rebooking with a different airline than the one you originally booked, especially if you were planning to fly a smaller carrier. If that\u2019s the case, remember that you\u2019ll get your money back from your original carrier, even if it takes a few weeks.\u201d\nThe laws around refunds have changed over time and can vary, depending on where your travels take you.\n\u201cFor example, under European law EC 261, travelers are eligible for up to $700 per person in airline compensation for avoidable flight disruptions, including delays over three hours, cancellations or denied boarding due to overbooking,\u201d explained Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of the passenger rights service AirHelp. \u201cThe exact same rule applies in the U.K. with UK261 regulation.\u201d\nThese laws require airlines to compensate passengers for flight disruptions that are considered the responsibility of the carrier, Pawliszyn said.\n\u201cThat includes any disruptions due to airline staff strikes \u2014 anything involving the employees of the airline carrier, including pilots, cabin crew, airline engineers, and other employees working directly under the airline,\u201d Pawliszyn said. \u201cHowever, you are not entitled to compensation if the strikes are outside of the airline\u2019s control. Strikes by airport security staff, baggage handlers, and air traffic controller staff are considered extraordinary circumstances.\u201d\nChecking your rights as a passenger is worth the time. AirHelp\u2019s free eligibility checker is one tool for passengers to determine whether they\u2019re entitled to compensation. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek help if anything is unclear.\n\u201cContact your travel agent, tour operator or airline and see if you are able to reschedule your booking or claim compensation,\u201d Candee said.\nConsider travel insurance.\nThe unforeseen challenges and general uncertainty of the pandemic led many to invest in travel insurance. While potential COVID-related disruptions are a common motivation, Candee noted that strikes could also be a good reason.\n\u201cAlthough travel insurance can\u2019t help to prevent vacation disruptions, it can help to avoid leaving you out of pocket later down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to purchase travel insurance as soon as you\u2019ve booked your trip. A travel insurance policy won\u2019t cover you for strike action if you buy it after the strike has been announced.\u201c\nAs always, make sure to read the fine print when purchasing travel insurance.\n\u201cNote that not all travel insurance policies cover claims related to strikes, though, so take the time to check your policy documents carefully to ensure that you are definitely covered,\u201d Candee said.\nTry to avoid hot areas.\n\u201cIt is important not to automatically conflate strikes with demonstrations, albeit they can be both,\u201d Moro explained.\nHe recommended avoiding the immediate vicinity of demonstrations when you can if you\u2019re not from the area.\n\u201cIt may be possible to visit the desired location early in the morning before the demonstration forms,\u201d Moro explained. \u201cSelect modes of transport and accommodation options that are less likely to be impacted.\u201d\nSome demonstrations may escalate, as well. He noted that response from authorities might include the use of tear gas, which may have short- and long-term health effects.\n\u201cDo not select hotels within proximity of potential flashpoints,\u201d Moro said. \u201cTeargas can travel a considerable distance and make remaining in affected nearby hotels very uncomfortable.\u201d\nPack comfortable shoes.\nComfy footwear options are a must on vacation for a number of reasons, and you should add potential demonstrations and labor disruptions to that list.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart idea to wear comfortable shoes when there is an anticipated strike,\u201d Moro said. \u201cIt could be a long walk back to your hotel if you can\u2019t find alternative travel accommodations.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-seat-to-book-economy-long-flight_l_6453baafe4b0452cee9be480": "Modern day air travel is famously not the most comfortable experience. After all, who wants to sit in a cramped seat next to strangers in a pressurized metal tube for hours on end?\nBig budget travelers will splurge on upgraded seats in business class or another premium cabin, but unfortunately, most of us can\u2019t afford to splash out like that. Still, there are ways to maximize comfort with your economy cabin seat choice.\n\u201cThe longer the flight, the more important it is to be strategic about your seat assignment,\u201d Zach Griff, a senior reporter at The Points Guy, told HuffPost.\nSo what\u2019s the best economy seat to choose for a long-haul flight? Although the answer can differ from aircraft to aircraft, there are some best practices to keep in mind. Some may seem contradictory, the key is to figure out what you value and prioritize those factors. Below, Griff and other experts share their advice, including some A+ hacks.\nMaximize your legroom.\n\u201cFirst things first, you\u2019ll want to maximize your personal space, which can mean splurging for an extra-legroom seat or strategically selecting a seat that sports a unique configuration, such as the exit row or bulkhead,\u201d Griff said.\nEven just a little extra space to stretch your legs can make a huge difference on a long-haul flight, so take that into consideration as you choose a seat. Although the exit row offers that nice extra room, avoid the row directly ahead of the exit.\n\u201cI\u2019d absolutely avoid the last row or the seats in front of the exit row,\u201d Griff added. \u201cThese seats offer little to no recline, so beware before selecting them.\u201d\nEven if you can\u2019t book a seat with extra space, you can still increase your legroom with careful packing. Try to fit most of your things into your checked bag or the carry-on suitcase that goes in the overhead bin to avoid having a bulky backpack or other stuff at your feet.\nIncrease your chances of sitting by an empty middle seat.\n\u201cI do my best to get an aisle seat next to an empty middle seat, or window seat next to an empty middle,\u201d said travel expert and author La Carmina. \u201cHaving an empty middle seat next to me lets me spread out and sleep better.\u201d\nShe increases her chances by looking for three-person rows in which the window seat is already taken and then selecting the empty aisle seat.\n\u201cThis way, there is now only an empty middle seat available in between, which is less likely to be taken,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I chose an aisle seat in an empty three-person row, chances are that two people who want to sit together might take the other two seats. I also try to choose seats closer to the back, since these tend to fill up last.\u201d\nKeep an eye out for empty rows.\n\u201cKindness goes a long way with gate agents,\u201d said travel expert and \u201cGaycation Travel Show\u201d host Ravi Roth. \u201cGenerally, I ask \u2014 nicely \u2014 if there is an empty row. If so, take it no matter where it is. Nothing is better than lying flat on an airplane.\u201d\nLa Carmina likes to take matters into her own hands.\n\u201cIf I notice a few empty rows of seats on the plane, I keep note of the locations,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the plane takes off and the fasten seatbelt sign goes off, I slip over and take the empty seats without asking the staff.\u201d\nAssess your proximity to the lavatory and galley.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to consider proximity to the galley and lavatories \u2014 all things that could get in the way of your comfort and ability to sleep during the flight,\u201d Griff said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find these spaces marked accordingly on seat maps, and unless you don\u2019t mind being disturbed by lights, noises and smells, you\u2019ll want to avoid these areas.\u201d\nAs the saying goes: location, location, location. Try to choose a seat at least four or five rows away from those high-traffic sections for a more peaceful journey.\n\u201cThere will be a lot of noise coming from the galley, which is the aircraft \u2018kitchen,\u2019 and there will be foot traffic and unpleasant sounds and smells from the bathroom,\u201d said Collette Stohler, a travel agent with Elite Travel Arrangements and director of marketing at Roamaroo.\nRemember the bulkhead isn\u2019t necessarily the best...\nThe first row of a cabin may seem like an enticing option, but there are a few things to keep in mind before choosing one of those bulkhead seats. Per the previous point, you might be near a noisy galley. There are other potential drawbacks as well.\n\u201cThough the bulkhead generally offers more legroom, you may want to steer clear of these seats,\u201d Griff said. \u201cNo one will recline into your personal space, but some drawbacks include misaligned TV screens, fixed armrests and a lack of under-seat storage. Plus, these seats are generally reserved for parents flying with infants, so it could get quite loud around these seats.\u201d\n...And the back of the plane isn\u2019t necessarily the worst.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to decide if you prefer to sit closer to the front or the back,\u201d Griff said. \u201cContrary to popular belief, sitting in the back of the plane actually has a few benefits.\u201d\nAgain, the front of the plane tends to fill up faster than the back, so you could have a less crowded experience in the back.\n\u201cI increase my chances of having a free seat, if not a full row next to me, the further back in the plane I\u2019m located,\u201d said Meg Jerrard, co-founder of Solo Female Travelers. \u201cSeats at the back of the plane will see a decent amount of foot traffic from passengers seeking out the bathrooms, but if I\u2019m asleep by that point because I have a free seat or row next to me, I\u2019m not conscious enough to complain!\u201d\nMany airlines offer travelers the opportunity to pay a little extra for a seat closer to the front of the plane. Ask yourself if it\u2019s worth the added cost.\n\u201cIf the only free seats that are left are middle seats, and paying for a seat selection is $25, you may be better off just footing the money,\u201d said Victoria Yore, the travel blogger behind Follow Me Away. \u201cBut if there are a variety of free seat selections open that are window or aisle seats, or otherwise your preferred arrangement for seat selection, go ahead and pick the free seat, even if it is in the back of the plane. You are going to have to wait for luggage anyway, and the deplaning process is usually always chaotic. Paying a bunch of money to be 10 rows up doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference or save you that much time anyway.\u201d\nCheck for unique layouts.\n\u201cI always recommend checking the SeatGuru website ahead of time to find the best seats on your particular aircraft,\u201d Stohler said.\nIndeed, not all plane layouts are the same, so the configuration might be yet another reason to look toward the back rather than the front.\n\u201cGenerally, most people assume that sitting closer to the front of the plane will make for a more comfortable flight experience,\u201d Griff said. \u201cWhile that\u2019s generally true, you\u2019ll want to study the seat map when booking your flight. Some planes feature unique \u2018mini-cabins\u2019 with just a few rows of seats. These smaller cabins are often significantly more private and quieter during the flight.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover, due to the curvature of some planes, many airlines offer a different seating configuration towards the back of the plane,\u201d he added. \u201cFor instance, instead of a general 3-3-3 layout, you might find a 2-3-2 layout towards the back of the plane. Those seats could be a great option for couples or families traveling together.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget other location factors.\n\u201cSome passengers seem to opt for the middle section near the wings where they are less likely to feel turbulence while others want to be near the front for ease of getting off the plane, less engine noise or even to get a better choice of food available,\u201d said Laura Lindsay, a travel trends and destinations expert at Skyscanner.\nShe pointed to a Skyscanner survey of more than 1,000 regular air travel passengers, which found that the most sought-after seat on a standard aircraft was 6A \u2014 a window option near the front. The \u201cworst\u201d was 31E, a middle seat toward the back of the aircraft.\n\u201cSitting in front of the wing and engines usually makes for a quieter ride,\u201d Griff noted.\nExamine your window or aisle preference.\n\u201cOnce you select your desired row, it\u2019s up to you to choose an aisle or window seat,\u201d Griff said. \u201cThe former is great for those who like the freedom to stand when they need to, while the latter is great for the views and the ability to rest your head on the fuselage of the plane.\u201d\nThere are pros and cons to each choice, and the experts HuffPost spoke to were divided. Roth is a fan of a window seat to avoid disturbances from the cart service and bathroom line, while Jerrard is all about the aisle.\n\u201cWhile the window seat is better for sleep in that you can rest up against the side of the plane, I prefer the aisle seat as it allows me to get up and down as much as I like without having to inconvenience anybody,\u201d she explained. \u201cBeing able to move around as you need to, is key to staying comfortable on a long-haul journey \u2014 keep the blood flowing with regular walks around the aisles.\u201d\nThose who like to get up and move their bodies may gravitate toward the aisle, but flyers who hate getting bumped into or asked to move are probably window people.\n\u201cThe window seems a popular choice for those looking to sleep, especially for long-haul flights, while those who take more trips to the toilet prefer the aisle so as not to disturb fellow passengers,\u201d Lindsay added. \u201cThe aisle is also popular for tall passengers looking to stretch their legs.\u201d\nThe calculus may change when you aren\u2019t flying alone.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re traveling as a couple, it could make sense to select an aisle and window seat in a given row, with the hopes that the middle remains empty,\u201d Griff said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, you can always trade one of your more favorable seats for the middle.\u201d\nBe warned that the middle seat trade is not a guarantee, however.\nResearch the type of aircraft.\nIf there are multiple good flight options for your trip, take a look at the different aircraft offerings. You may find more comfortable options on newer planes.\n\u201cFrequent flyers have also reported that the left-hand side of the plane is best as the windows are off-center, allowing for wall space to lean on,\u201d Lindsay noted.\nSuch features can vary, but airline websites and third-party resources can provide information about different types of planes and carriers.\n\u201cDelta helped pioneer the \u2018articulating seat bottom\u2019 \u2014 that not only moves you slightly forward but also up when reclined, cradling you in the seat for optimal comfort \u2015 without sacrificing legroom,\u201d said Mauricio Parise, vice president of brand experience at Delta Air Lines.\nHe noted that almost all mainline Delta aircraft currently have the articulating seat bottom, and there are plans to update the one exception to match that standard.\nOther plane features that airlines are exploring include \u201cpre-reclined\u201d seats and economy bunk beds.\nBook early.\n\u201cMore than anything, be sure to select your seat as soon as you book your flight,\u201d Griff said. \u201cThe earlier, the better. If you wait to book your seat, you\u2019ll likely find fewer options as departure nears.\u201d\nBooking with an airline co-branded credit card can also come with preferred seat coupons or fast-track to airline status, which leads to complimentary seat upgrades with more legroom, he added.\nWhen you don\u2019t get to choose your seat during the booking process, try to check in early.\n\u201cIf I have an economy seat without prior seat selection, I always check in online as soon as the 24-hour window opens before boarding,\u201d La Carmina said. \u201cI set an alarm or notification to check-in as soon as it\u2019s allowed. This way, I have the first choice of available seats.\u201d\nDon\u2019t despair if you\u2019re unhappy with the seat you snagged.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t snag your ideal seat, ExpertFlyer is a fantastic tool to improve your seat assignment,\u201d Griff noted. \u201cThe web-based software lets you set seat alerts for any flight, and you\u2019ll be instantly notified by email and/or text message if your preferred seat eventually opens up.\u201d\nLooking to make your travels even easier?

But some places are so magical that they call for a return visit \u2015 or many. And a lot of these special spots are right here in the United States.\n\u201cThere is truly no place like home,\u201d Kareem George, a travel adviser and founder of Culture Traveler, told HuffPost. \u201cIt is always wonderful to appreciate and enjoy the many destination gems right in our own backyard.\u201d\nThe country possesses an incredible diversity of landscapes and attractions across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.\n\u201cOverall, I think there are certain destinations in the U.S. that have a magnetic pull, whether it\u2019s because of their unique culture, natural beauty, or rich history,\u201d said Claire Summers, the travel blogger behind Claire\u2019s Itchy Feet. \u201cIt\u2019s these qualities that draw us back again and again, and I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to explore and experience these destinations.\u201d\nWe asked experts in the travel space to share the U.S. destinations they\u2019ve returned to multiple times.

But visitors to such hot spots can also expect massive crowds and peak prices.\nThere is, however, another way to explore exciting destinations without those drawbacks. It\u2019s called \u201csecond city\u201d travel. But what exactly is it and how do you take full advantage of this kind of trip? Below, travel experts break it down.\nWhat is a \u201csecond city\u201d trip?\n\u201cSecond-city travel means skipping the most popular city or region in an area and visiting the second-, third-, or fourth- (and so on) most-known spots,\u201d said Phil Dengler, co-founder of The Vacationer. \u201cUltimately, you are avoiding the traditional and known tourist destinations that are often overcrowded. Instead of visiting Miami, you could visit Fort Lauderdale or Palm Beach.\u201d\nAlthough the literal meaning of the term refers to a country\u2019s second most famous or populous city, it has indeed expanded to refer more generally to lesser-known destinations. Over the years, some have also interpreted \u201csecond city\u201d travel to mean tacking on one of these less popular destinations to a trip built around a classic spot like Rome.\n\u201cOften it\u2019s the smaller, lesser known city in a region,\u201d said Laura Lindsay, a travel trends and destinations expert at Skyscanner. \u201cFor example, in Southern California, San Diego would be considered a \u2018second city\u2019 and Los Angeles a primary city and on the East Coast, Boston would be the \u2018second city\u2019 and New York City the primary city.\u201d\n\u201cSecond cities\u201d might not be the most obvious choices for tourists, but these more under-the-radar destinations can still offer enough attractions, food and cultural experiences to make for a wonderful vacation.\nWhat are the benefits of second city travel?\n\u201cSecond cities often have fewer crowds, are cheaper, and offer a more authentic experience,\u201d Dengler said. \u201cWhile places like New York City have a ton to offer, they can often feel hollow and inauthentic with tourist attractions at every corner.\u201d\nIn addition to the affordability and greater sense of calm, second cities can also provide a special charm and more unique travel experience.\n\u201cThe main benefit of second city travel is discovering hidden gems and off-the-beaten path locations,\u201d said Ravi Roth, a travel expert and host of \u201cThe Gaycation Travel Show.\u201d \u201cI recently traveled to Italy and Venice, and took an hour train ride to Verona, which offers incredible food, landmarks and hidden gems. The best part was that it wasn\u2019t overly populated.\u201d\nVisiting a destination that isn\u2019t overrun with tourists allows travelers to better interact with the community that lives there.\n\u201cThese trips can provide opportunities to connect with locals and become immersed in the culture, which leads to a deeper understanding of the city,\u201d said Gordon Gurnik, chief operating officer at Hilton Grand Vacations.\nDrawing from Skyscanner data, Lindsay noted that smaller island or coastal destinations like Crete, Mallorca and Cancun are attractive options for travelers looking to visit Greece, Spain or Mexico.\n\u201cUnderstated second cities definitely don\u2019t stand in the shadows of their more showy neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cOften packed with local flair, amazing food, great value and a more laid-back pace, second cities are not to be missed.\u201d\nIn this era of overtourism, turning to second city trips also help mitigate the negative impact that the travel industry can have on the environment.\n\u201cWe have seen a rise in people looking for ways to make tourism more sustainable,\u201d said travel blogger Rocky Trifari. \u201cThe second cities trend helps reduce the heavy burden on the most frequently visited cities while opening up the possibility for tourists to walk a path (slightly) less traveled!\u201d\nHow can you plan a top-notch second city trip?\n\u201cWhen planning a second city trip, I recommend researching the most populous places within driving distance of the top one,\u201d Dengler advised. \u201cDoing that betters your odds of being able to fly into an international airport, which are often cheaper and have better routes than regional ones.\u201d\nIndeed, a drawback of second cities is that they sometimes require a more expensive or inconvenient combination of planes, trains and automobiles to get there. Be mindful of transportation options as you choose a destination.\n\u201cThe biggest con to second city travel is that the most popular city is the most popular for a reason,\u201d added travel blogger Sean Lau. \u201cChances are, you might miss some of the most iconic landmarks and attractions of a destination by going to the \u2018second city\u2019 instead.\u201d\nBut even if you aren\u2019t seeing a country or state\u2019s classic sites, you can still have a fulfilling and exciting experience in your second city of choice.\n\u201cPick a place that has enough things for you to do and consider booking a room at a smaller boutique hotel or bed and breakfast,\u201d Dengler said.\nWherever you decide to go, make sure to do your research ahead of time.\n\u201c\u2018Second cities\u2019 are sometimes not as developed as the \u2018main\u2019 city, especially if you are not in a very developed country,\u201d Lau noted. \u201cThis might mean you\u2019ll need to rent your own car to get around, or this might mean you need to avoid certain neighborhoods because they are potentially dangerous. And if you are visiting a foreign country where English is not common, the \u2018second city\u2019 might require you to know a little bit of the local language.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/underrated-capital-cities-us_l_63e56c48e4b02c257375146e": "Many U.S. capital cities have long been major tourist destinations, like Boston, Denver, Nashville and Austin.

Or maybe you remembered all the cords \u2014for your phone, watch, Kindle, etc. \u2014 but you don\u2019t have enough charging blocks, which is a problem now that we have so many things to charge. A viral Instagram reel full of travel hacks suggests using a USB port on the back of a hotel room television to charge your phone \u2014 Travel + Leisure, Lifehacker and others agree \u2014 but cybersecurity experts, the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission aren\u2019t so sure.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an element of risk in our day-to-day lives, and the goal of cybersecurity is risk mitigation,\u201d said Monica Eaton, who deals with the financial consequences of scams and data theft as the founder of Chargebacks911, a company that helps consumers reverse charges to their debit or credit cards after fraud. \u201cThere might even be situations when it makes sense to expose yourself to increased risk because the benefits outweigh the potential harms.\u201d\nCharging your phone is an excellent example of this.\nPhone chargers are an easy item to leave behind at home or in your previous hotel accidentally, so if the need to have your phone charged outweighs the risk of plugging into a public port, it might be worth it. Still, experts say you should consider other options, including shelling out the cash to pay for an overpriced charger from a newsstand or airport kiosk or buying a junky one from a gas station.\nBut if it\u2019s late, you\u2019re at your hotel, and you just realized you don\u2019t have your charger, how bad is it really to use the one on the TV?\nWhy The USB Port On A Hotel Television Is A Bad Idea\n\u201cAny public device \u2014 whether it\u2019s a computer in the hotel\u2019s business center, a TV in the hotel room, a public charging station, a public WiFi network, a Roku box in an Airbnb, etc. \u2014 is potentially dangerous since it is publicly accessible and you don\u2019t know how secure it is,\u201d explained Chris Pierson, founder and CEO of BlackCloak, a digital executive protection company.\n\u201cWhile it may seem less risky to plug into the back of the TV in your hotel room, just remember that many other people may have done the same thing, which means they could have deliberately or unintentionally infected it with malware,\u201d Pierson said.\n\u201cAdditionally, if the TV connects to the hotel\u2019s WiFi network, a remote hacker could potentially spread malware to it that way, too.\u201d\nThe FBI told me they defer on the details of this issue to the FCC, which warns about \u201cjuice jacking\u201d from public charging stations on its website. \u201cMalware installed through a corrupted USB port can lock a device or export personal data and passwords directly to the perpetrator. Criminals can then use that information to access online accounts or sell it to other bad actors,\u201d the FCC stated.\nWhat seems like a great \u201clife hack\u201d might lead to you being hacked, and suddenly a drained cell phone battery won\u2019t seem like a huge hassle compared to dealing with your compromised information.\n\u201cBad actors have become adept at slipping their gadgets into public places \u2014airports, airline lounges, hotel lobbies and rooms, and other public locations,\u201d said Chris Hauk, consumer privacy advocate at Pixel Privacy. \u201cBy plugging into a compromised USB charging port, users are leaving their devices open to malware and spyware installations on their device.\u201d\nYou Probably Shouldn\u2019t Use Any Public USB Ports\n\u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s impossible to know whether a charging station is just charging your battery or trying to do other things until after you plug it in,\u201d said Paul Bischoff, a privacy advocate at Comparitech.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably best to avoid them altogether. But dedicated charging stations like the ones in airports and planes should be a little safer.\u201d\nBischoff explained that the ports on airplanes are intended for public use and, therefore, should be secured and monitored by a professional IT team employed by the airport or airline, as opposed to an unmonitored hotel TV that just happens to have a USB port.\nSteven J.J. Weisman, a lawyer, author, professor of white-collar crime at Bentley University, and an expert in scams, identity theft and cybersecurity, described plugging into a hotel television\u2019s USB port as pretty low-risk, but he, too, warned against the public USB charging stations in airport, malls, concert venues, etc. In addition, Weisman pointed out that although most cell phone manufacturers have improved their phones\u2019 security, consumers must always keep their software current.\nIf You See This Warning Sign, Unplug Your Phone Immediately\n\u201cIf you use an iPhone and decide to use a public USB charger such as [those] found at airports and other sites, watch your screen when you plug in your phone because if the USB charger has been corrupted with malware, your phone will ask you if you want to trust the device,\u201d Weisman explained.\n\u201cThe answer to that question is a resounding NO. If that message appears when you plug in your device to the charger, you should immediately unplug your phone.\u201d\nBecause of this, it makes sense to keep track of chargers the way you do medication or prescription eyeglasses \u2014 don\u2019t forget them. Eaton suggested carrying a travel-safe backup battery pack for when you might have a charger but not a wall outlet to plug into.\nWant to avoid all this?

Not only is it powered by the sun, but it's waterproof, shock-resistant and has an LED flashlight and a compass as well. This reliable, durable and easy-to-use charger is compatible with iPhone, Samsung, HTC, Nexus, Go-Pro cameras, tablets and other USB devices. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and 5,883 five-star reviews.Promising review:\n\"We got three of these for camping. Charged them up via USB when they arrived. It's been 12 days, and we've charged our phones 5x off one of them, without having to recharge it at all, except for letting it sit out in a sunny window for a few hours each afternoon. Based on how many phone charges we got out of a single USB charge plus a little sunlight, I feel very happy with this product. They're pretty lightweight, the included carabiner makes it easy to hang from a backpack or in a window, and the included flashlight is a nice touch. I also appreciate dual USB ports, so you can charge two devices at once. My only tiny issue is that the power button for the flashlight feature is small and hard to distinguish from the rest of the colored bits on the edges of the charger. You sort of have to memorize where it is for quick access should you need a flashlight. Now that I know where the power button is, it's not an issue. Many of these solar chargers are WAY more expensive than this model. Why pay more when this one works so well? Glad I chose this brand and model. Superhappy with this purchase!\" \u2014 Amazonmasterz\nA lipstick-sized charger\nKeep your Apple products at full charge with this small and, dare we say, elegant mini external charger.

I have an iPhone and my parents both have androids and it charged two phones at the same time without any issues. Also, I was able to fly with the charger which is great! I just didn\u2019t pack it in my suitcase or use it on the plane. I like how the paw print on the front lights up blue to tell you how much of a charge you have left and I also like the book light that came with it but will probably never use it. We used the mesh bag it comes with to stack our two different charging cords then when we needed to charge we had everything we needed in the bag. If you\u2019re on the fence, get it. It was worth it.\" \u2014 Kimberly\nA charger with a smart LED display\nThis quick-charging device has insanely high charging capacity with the ability to hold more than eight charges for an iPhone 12, while the LED display screen makes it easy to know how much you've got left.

I have had it about a year now and goes everywhere with me. 2 weeks ago im charging my phone and bluetooth speaker while walking in the woods with my dog on our property, as i lift many 16ozer's During the day and night I dont realized that i misplaced it, until morning after a Long day of cold rain. Couldn't find it in camper so I assume i dropped in the woods. well 2 weeks later after many days of rain ice and snow, with temps between 29f and 40 f I was walking though woods again when my dog happened upon it, frozen but still able to produce 1 led light. brought in camper, warmed it up for a while and charged it up. i Can honestly say that it is charging my phone right now while righting this review. great product.\" \u2014 urbanmusher\nA charger with a built-in wall plug\nFree yourself from the tangle of cables with this multi-functional portable charger.

It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and 7,019 five-star ratings. Promising review\n: \"I honestly don't even know where to start with this portable charger. I literally don't go ANYWHERE without it. It has been the greatest thing to ever exist. My last phone (iPhone X) just up and died on me one day ... completely out of nowhere. I wasn't in a place where I could get a new phone right away, so I had to hook up my old iPhone 6s and live on that for a few weeks. It was fine apart from one thing ... the battery lasted MAYBE 2 hours. I use my phone for everything, including work, so I could not have it dying in the middle of the day. This charger was an absolute life saver! Not only that, but it includes cords for all phone types, so if my friend is at dinner with me, we can both charge our phones at the same time with this!! Granted, you'd have to have different phones (i.e. iPhone and Android). Plus it is small enough to throw in a purse and take with you anywhere! This was one of the greatest purchases I have EVER made. And I'd happily buy this again and again and again! Makes an awesome gift too!\" \u2014 McKenna P.\nA lightweight slim external charger\nThis wildly popular charger is incredibly slim and lightweight compared to other options and is compatible with most smartphones and devices.

So just how exactly people satisfy that desire is what will drive destination popularity in 2023.\u201d\nWith that in mind, where do experts see travelers flocking to next year? Below, we share their predictions for next year\u2019s trending travel destinations.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airbnb-vacation-rental-safety-check-in_l_62cee634e4b0942327835363": "With the rise of platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo, short-term vacation rentals have become an increasingly popular alternative to hotels. In the age of COVID-19, many travelers prefer the option to avoid the person-to-person contact of staying at a busy hotel by booking a single-family home instead.\nBut there are safety concerns that arise with the vacation rental experience.\n\u201cWhile many hotels have security guards and someone at a front desk keeping an eye on the property 24/7, Airbnbs do not,\u201d Cheryl Nelson, a travel preparedness expert and founder of Prepare with Cher, told HuffPost. \u201cIf you have a concern at an Airbnb, there usually isn\u2019t a manager or employee on-site or another room you may move to. If you\u2019re traveling solo and need help, a hotel will typically have people on staff 24/7 to assist, while Airbnbs may not.\u201d\nOver the years, companies like Airbnb and Vrbo have taken steps to improve safety \u2015 from banning parties to providing safety checklists to establishing a Trust & Safety Advisory Coalition.\n\u201cStaying at a short-term rental property is generally safe,\u201d said Jeremy Prout, director of security solutions at International SOS. \u201cLike booking any accommodation, the traveler needs to ensure they understand the risk of the neighborhood and take general precautions that they would for staying anywhere. Many of the concerns about safety and privacy issues are driven by viral videos or posts that are not consistent with the overall experience.\u201d\nRare or not, dangerous can things happen during travel, including at vacation rentals. That said, there are ways to diminish the risks.\nBelow, experts share the safety steps travelers should take when they arrive at a vacation rental. They also offered some advice for keeping safety in mind when booking these accommodations.\n1. Check for cameras.\n\u201cAsk the host if there are security cameras so there is full disclosure,\u201d Nelson advised. \u201cHidden cameras are prohibited, but for your own privacy, you may want to do a scan inside the house to make sure you don\u2019t unwillingly end up on camera.\u201d\nAirbnb specifically prohibits hidden cameras or other recording devices and requires hosts to disclose the presence of any such implements. Recording devices are also not permitted in private spaces like bedrooms and bathrooms, though they are allowed in common areas.\nVrbo doesn\u2019t allow any sort of surveillance devices inside its properties, though hosts are allowed to place cameras outside the home, so long as their locations are shared with guests. Still, over the years, there have been several news stories about travelers discovering hidden cameras in their vacation rentals.\n\u201cThey\u2019re typically in areas where you would expect privacy,\u201d said travel safety consultant Kevin Coffey. \u201cThink smoke detectors in bedrooms, light fixtures in bathrooms, even alarm clocks next to beds.\u201d\nHe emphasized these concealed recording device instances are rare and that many hosts simply install visible cameras in permitted areas due to the countless incidents of guests trashing rental properties during their stays. Still, if you\u2019re concerned about hidden cameras, there are ways to check for them when you arrive.\n\u201cYou can use a Wi-Fi checker,\u201d Coffey said, noting that network-scanning apps like Fing can inform guests of any unknown devices that are connected to the Wi-Fi.\nKeep an eye out for objects that appear to be altered or out of place, and if you have suspicions, consider draping a piece of clothing over them.\n\u201cUse a flashlight with the lights off to look for reflections off camera lenses,\u201d Nelson suggested. \u201cPeer into vents covers and other openings in the wall where a small camera could be hidden. Unscrew and inspect smoke alarms and other wall- or ceiling-mounted appliances.\u201d\n2. Store your valuables safely.\n\u201cFor the safety of your belongings, ask if the property has a safe,\u201d Nelson suggested.\nItems like your passport, electronics, jewelry and other valuables should go in the most secure location, and many rentals provide safe storage. Sometimes, you might have to bring your own padlock, which provides extra security as only you know the code.\n\u201cThere are also portable safes you can travel with,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cThey\u2019re usually cloth with wire mesh sandwiched between two layers of canvas, and there\u2019s a braided steel cable, so the only way for a thief to get into the bag would be to have bolt cutters.\u201d\nHe recommended the brand Pacsafe, which has a variety of anti-theft items, including portable safes.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a safe, gauge whether you should leave stuff lying around that can be seen through windows,\u201d Coffey advised. \u201cYou don\u2019t want important items to be visible.\u201d\nIf you have a car parked outside, make sure to remove your belongings to avoid vehicle break-ins.\n\u201cYou can also bring a camera to monitor your valuables as long as you remember to remove it by the time you check out,\u201d said Cathy Pedrayes, a safety expert and author of \u201cThe Mom Friend Guide to Everyday Safety and Security.\u201d\n3. Confirm the presence of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.\nFire safety is always a concern, but after three American tourists died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a resort in the Bahamas in May, travelers are on extra high alert for that silent killer as well.\n\u201cCheck to ensure each floor of the rental has working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors,\u201d Nelson advised.\nRental booking platforms like Airbnb allow hosts to note whether or not they have a smoke or CO detector on the property, but it\u2019s worth checking that they\u2019re on when you arrive.\n\u201cYou can also purchase portable smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and take them with you when you travel,\u201d Coffey added.\n4. Get the lay of the land.\n\u201cAfter I set my bags down at a rental, I just walk around the space and get the lay of the land,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cTry to see where all the doors are and test them out. So many people see a door but might not realize it\u2019s bolted shut, so that\u2019s not a way out in case of a fire.\u201d\nDuring your inspection, create a mental escape plan for emergencies. Look for the first aid kit and fire extinguisher. Coffey said he inspects the fire extinguisher to make sure it\u2019s charged and functioning.\n\u201cRemember that when you\u2019re in a house, there are a lot of points of entry that could be used to break in when you\u2019re not around \u2015 whereas a hotel room usually only has the one door,\u201d he added. \u201cCheck your door and window locks to see how secure things are from a break-in standpoint.\u201d\nConsider the safety needs of your fellow travelers in mind as you scan the property. \u201cIf traveling with children, survey the area and look for glass or sharp objects, ensure that the TV is secure, if it is within reach,\u201d Prout said.\nScope out the general area where you\u2019re staying as well by walking around and looking at the map on your phone.\n\u201cYou should be aware of local emergency resources \u2015 police station, fire station, hospitals, pharmacies \u2015 should there be an emergency during your stay,\u201d Prout said.\n5. Set up your own alarms.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re staying in a street-level apartment or a place with lots of windows, consider if it makes sense for you to bring in additional door and window security devices,\u201d Coffey said.\nAsk your host or look for yourself to see if there are already alarms and outdoor sensor lights. Even if there are, you may still want extra protection.\nCoffey noted that portable motion detectors are not particularly expensive and can alert you if someone is trying to break into a door or window. Similarly, portable locks can help keep your rental extra secure.\n\u201cBring a small, portable door stop alarm,\u201d Nelson echoed. \u201cThis one from Damsel in Defense is one of my favorites.\u201d\n6. Turn on tracking.\nWhen you\u2019re traveling, it\u2019s always a good idea to let loved ones know where you\u2019ll be. You can text them the address of your rental when you check in and share your reservation confirmation.\nCoffey suggested even going a step further.\n\u201cTurn on tracking for your loved ones so that they can see where exactly you are and know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said, pointing to apps like Find My Friends. \u201cYou should do this especially if you\u2019re a solo traveler.\u201d\nPedrayes recommended having designated people you can call in case of an emergency.\n\u201cBefore you arrive at a location, know your emergency numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cIs there Wi-Fi or cell service? Who can you call back home to help? Do you speak the language, if not, do you have a way to communicate in case of an emergency?\u201d\nKeep vacation rental safety in mind even before your trip.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt unsafe while staying at an Airbnb, but I always do my research prior to booking,\u201d Nelson said, adding that she tries to choose properties from Airbnb \u201cSuperhosts\u201d when possible due to their experience and top ratings. \u201cFamiliarize yourself with the local area and always read the Airbnb guests\u2019 reviews, so there aren\u2019t any surprises.\u201d\nShe also recommended resources like CrimeMapping.com to \u201cunderstand the vulnerabilities\u201d of a particular area. Google Street View can help you see what the street and entrance look like as well.\n\u201cA short-term rental property may look great in photos, but be sure to research the neighborhood \u2015 you will be interacting with it, including coming and going with luggage,\u201d Prout noted. \u201cA simple search can provide you with an overview of the risks. If you\u2019re not sure, ask the host. If you\u2019re still not sure, find another accommodation.\u201d\nIn addition to crime concerns, Coffey said some travelers like to consider if an area is good fit from a cultural perspective.\n\u201cA person of color, someone who\u2019s LGBTQ, a woman traveler \u2015 they might want to take a deeper dive and look at safety scores from different apps and websites,\u201d he explained. \u201cGeoSure offers helpful ratings.\u201d\nHe also suggested parents traveling with children check the sex offender registry for the neighborhood. Meanwhile, Prout urged travelers to think about the types of accommodation they\u2019re searching.\n\u201cWhen it comes to safety, booking individual room rentals instead of an entire property can put a traveler at risk as the guest may find themselves sharing a home or an apartment with other people, which can increase the likelihood of a security incident \u2015 assault, harassment, etc.,\u201d he said.\nStill, Prout added, there\u2019s no simple solution for avoiding all risk.\n\u201cThe reality is that emergencies can happen anywhere, at any time,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cTherefore, there is no one answer when it comes to ensuring your safety when booking lodging accommodations. The best thing a traveler can do to protect themselves is to do research ahead of booking accommodations to determine the level of risk associated with the location and plan accordingly.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/overweight-luggage-bag-fee-travel_l_62b361b4e4b0cf43c85f3817": "Promising reviews for the Etekcity luggage scale:\n\u201cGreat to travel with...Used [it] for four bags to stay under 50 pounds during travel to avoid overweight baggage fees.

Any inaccuracy would potentially have costed me since my bags were packed within ounces of tipping the 50-pound limits. This was a great buy!\u201d \u2015 LAW\n\u201cWe like to travel. With big suitcases that flirt with that 50 pound limit. In the old days, we would lug our bathroom scale into the living room and stand on the scale holding the luggage which was a bit awkward but ok it worked. The real problem came when we got ready to head back home ... no bathroom scale. Now we just strap this scale to the luggage handle, lift it slightly off the ground, and we get an exact weight. It\u2019s small enough to pack and take along. We love it so much we bought a second one. No traveler should be without this handy tool. Or at least no traveler who likes to pack to the brim!\u201d \u2015 Chandelier\n\u201cThis is a great purchase to save you money at the airport. Took a trip recently and was checking in three bags. With this handy little scale, it gave me accurate weights of each piece of luggage that I had. I previously had anther brand that was a dial scale with a small hook. The hook was not big enough and the dial would bounce back and forth and you couldn\u2019t get an accurate reading. With the hook latching on to the scale itself, it is very secure [and] the digital readout makes it very simple to see what the weight of your luggage is. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is traveling and is worried about excessive weight in their baggage.\u201d \u2015 RJ", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/travel-items-you-need_l_62b2264ae4b04a61736297b0": "Popular items from this list\nHuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

It charges an iPad faster than plugging it into AC, even while using it! The size is very manageable \u2014 about the size of a deck of cards. I travel frequently, and I'm not always near a power source. I just make sure to charge the Anker each evening and then none of my devices will be without power during the day. I was so happy with it, I purchased two more \u2014 one for my husband and one for my sister who can't seem to remember to keep her devices charged.\" \u2014 Cathy K\nA set of 12 charcoal odor absorber bags so you never have to worry about your shoes smelling\nPromising review:\n\"Stinky shoes be gone! These guys are on the smaller size (1\u201dx3\u201d each) so I put two each in my size 10 Women\u2019s shoes when I pack them up for travel. I LOVE that they make the stinks go away. They don\u2019t add any particular scent either. It\u2019s just a neutral sucking up of the 'stop wearing those shoes' scent blues. I\u2019ve used them in my favorite ballet flats and shiny sneakers. My dog approves.\" \u2013 Izzi\nWireless noise-cancelling headphones so you can tune out distracting background noise on the plane\nPromising review:\n\"Now that I\u2019ve had these headphones for a couple of weeks, I can\u2019t imagine my life without them. I chose them because they were the highest rated noise cancelling headphones in this price range reviewed by Consumer Reports. These headphones work SO well at blocking out the noises I was getting so distracted by. I also listen to podcasts and meditations on them, but not really music so I can\u2019t really speak to their sound quality there. I use them for work (Teams meetings or listening to live broadcasts) and they work well. The battery life is great and I could probably get through two full days on a charge.\" \u2014 Kelly\nPortable soap paper sheets that get instantly sudsed up with a drop of water\nPromising review:\n\"Exactly what I wanted! Hands feel very clean after wash! Highly recommend! I read other reviews and decided these had the best reviews, and those reviews did not disappoint! Each sheet of soap produces enough soap to give the comfort of knowing your hands are throughly clean. We liked our first order so much that we bought 10 packs for my fianc\u00e9's work crew to help make keeping their hands clean during this pandemic! (He\u2019s a delivery driver/repair tech.)

They are half the price of MaxTrax and just as good, I haven't used them as a bridge, but they literally saved my and my wife's lives in a recent Colorado Blizzard on a horrible mountain pass. Good tires, and 4LO couldn't get me up the 12% grade in about 1' of fresh snow on top of 1-2\" of ice and we were just sliding sideways toward the literal cliff.

I keep one in the house bathroom and one with me at all times. I even bought one for each of my relatives. I was always too subconscious about pooing in any public or private bathroom unless it was my own. When my friend heard about it and knew of my shy problem, he ordered it for me.

I travel fairly frequently and always have issues with ear pressure on the plane. My ears will be clogged up, and it is painful to swallow for a day or two after short-distance flights. But now, I use these and fly incident-free. You are supposed to insert them before the plane takes off and then before landing. I have found that it works best if I leave them in the entire flight from before takeoff until landing, but they work almost as well if you take them out once you reach cruising altitude.\" \u2014 Thomasina\nA portable espresso maker so you can have a fresh cup of joe while on a road trip\nPromising review:\n\"The best thing for traveling ever!! I have to have espresso every morning and most small hotels and gas stations don't have espresso coffee so this is perfect! Easy to use.

I took it backpacking on Maine's Bigelow range. When I ran out of the water I brought, I was A-OK with this. Just bring a wide mouth bottle to fill with water you find. On top of one of the lower peaks, I drank from the most disgusting-looking crevice filled with brown scum. I thought, this is going to be safe, but taste horrid. WRONG. TASTED LIKE THE FRESHEST SPRING WATER. Better than any tap. I'm from Maine, and I've tasted plenty of water right from mountain springs, so take my word. One caution: it can be a little challenging to start. You have to prove it by soaking. If it still doesn't work, blow into it a bit.\" \u2014 Amazon customer\nA mask bracket that allows you to be fully and safely covered\nA lot of reviewers also mentioned this was great for saving their lipstick or when fabric from masks gets wet in the rain! Promising review\n: \"These make it so much easier to have a conversation since your mask isn't right on your mouth and you don't sound all muffled. Another benefit is I don't have to speak as loudly. I'm not so sure about being cooler with this because it always feels hot when I have my mask on. There are some clips on both ends of these but I'm not sure how they are used. I find they stay in place if my mask is nice and snug, which it should be.

I travel a lot, and so does my husband, and this pad makes packing so much easier and stress free. The list is quite extensive, while I probably will never need to pack all of it for one trip, but it covers everything for a business trip or a pleasure trip.

I was walking to the bus and decided it was a great decision to drink coffee while walking. Like a scene from an infomercial, I spilled coffee all over my white shirt. Yes, the classic coffee on the white shirt. Luckily I had one of these in my bag (I put one in each of my most-used purses in anticipation of my clumsiness). I went into a store bathroom and quickly scrubbed the Tide To Go on my shirt. All of the coffee blobs went away and once the awkward wet splotches dried up, my shirt was perfectly white again.

It is a little greasy when you first start rubbing it in, but it absorbs quickly and that along with the smell (a bit medicinal) dissipates before you know it. It doesn't take much of this at all. I rub a little on my tired feet at the end of the day as well, and trust me I have tired feet after being on them for 14-plus hours. This stuff works great for this as well. Win-win, Weleda!\" \u2014 Lauren\nA beach blanket made from parachute nylon that is water- and sand-proof\nThe blanket comes with four securing anchors.Promising review:\n\"I recently purchased this blanket for a family vacation to Florida, and everyone LOVED it! It's lightweight, big enough for the whole family to lay out on, and the sand rolled right off. One of the things I loved most about it is that it rolled up super compact and light so it was easy to pack! When you are going to the beach with kids, you drag along a lot of equipment! It was nice that this was easy to pack and travel with. Fun fact: If you have one of those canopies to bring to the beach, this blanket fits perfectly under it!\" \u2014 Megan\nA portable luggage scale\nPromising review:\n\"This luggage scale is so handy and is great for weighing your luggage. I was a little concerned before I got it because I wasn't sure how accurate it would be. When I used it when I went on vacation, it was dead-on to what the airport said, so I highly recommend this.

With global warming, human damage and the disintegration of traditions, the threat to planet Earth's most beautiful wonders is very real. Now is the time to witness these precious places before they change forever.\nVideos For You", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mistakes-summer-travel_l_6220147fe4b0a7b54cd90d70": "With school breaks and extra sunshine, the months of June, July and August tend to be peak tourist season for Americans.\nIt\u2019s also peak season for rookie travel mistakes. So we asked travel experts to share the common missteps they see tourists make when it comes to their summer vacations.\nFrom poor timing to lack of research, here are just a few summer travel errors \u2015 and some advice for avoiding them.\nPicking mega-popular destinations\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes many people make when planning their summer vacations is going to the super popular tourist destinations,\u201d Claire Summers, the travel blogger behind Claire\u2019s Itchy Feet, told HuffPost. \u201cPersonally, I look for up-and-coming destinations that aren\u2019t so overcrowded and overpriced. One thing I like to do is use the \u2018anywhere\u2019 function on Skyscanner or Google Flights to find the best flight deals and then take it from there.\u201d\nOf course, tourists flock to Paris, Rome, London, Las Vegas, Miami and other top destinations during the summer. But consider alternative options if you want to avoid crowds and expensive accommodations.\n\u201cInstead of waiting in long lines, sweating in 95-degree heat to see the Colosseum, look slightly off the beaten path,\u201d said Willis Orlando, senior product operations specialist at Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights. \u201cScandinavia makes a great summer alternative. The weather is fresher, crowds are smaller and there\u2019s tons of daylight.\u201d\nNot researching enough\nAn important aspect of enjoying a new destination \u2015 particularly if it\u2019s in a foreign country \u2015 is managing expectations.\n\u201cThe most common mistake is assuming that everything is the same as home, when in reality the majority of tourists travel to experience something different,\u201d said Alan Fyall, the Visit Orlando endowed chair of tourism management and associate dean of academic affairs at the University of Central Florida\u2019s Rosen College of Hospitality Management.\n\u201cSuch complaints in the industry are commonplace, with tourists frequently expressing their surprise that when in Spain, Spanish food is served, when in France, French is spoken and when in Florida, gators do really exist in lakes,\u201d he added.\nResearch and due diligence minimize the opportunity for error or disappointment. While you don\u2019t have to plan every little detail, travel blogger Katie McIntosh emphasized at least getting a base-level understanding of what to expect at your destination.\n\u201cOne example of this is travelers who visit Europe in the peak summer season, only to be disappointed by the crowds, expenses and traffic,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cFor example, many Italians get their annual leave at the same time in August and head for the popular summer locations. If you plan your visit at the same time, your vacation might be more crowded and stressful than the dreamy, summer vacation you imagined.\u201d\nUnderestimating the heat\n\u201cClimate change has been driving up summer temperatures, and this will only worsen over the next years and decades,\u201d said travel blogger and TV host La Carmina. \u201cLast year, for example, Vancouver had a horrific heat dome and people had to stay indoors for several days to make it through. Many travelers do not take into account the unbearably high summer temperatures that now plague places like Spain, Italy and Arizona \u2015 and when they are there, they are unable to walk around or enjoy activities due to the heat.\u201d\nShe advised choosing destinations, activities and accommodations with the climate in mind. If you\u2019re booking a rental, for example, make sure it has air conditioning. Pack accordingly as well.\n\u201cI think many people underestimate the heat when planning their summer travels,\u201d said Stephanie Be, a travel blogger and founder of the travel website Buena. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in cute Instagrammable essentials, but then overlook the things you actually need like sunblock, mosquito repellent, and inexpensive sunglasses that someone might steal in a busy city.\u201d\nWaiting too long to book\n\u201cDo not wait. I repeat: Do not wait. There are wild deals right now,\u201d said Ravi Roth, a travel expert and host of \u201cThe Gaycation Travel Show.\u201d \u201cFind the flight deals. Book now, cancel or change later!\u201d\nGiven the popularity of summer travel, you\u2019ll want to secure airfare, accommodations and rental cars well in advance. Otherwise, you may lose out on available options and have to pay higher prices.\n\u201cFor trips to closer destinations, you\u2019ll want to book your travel between one and four months out, so right now is the perfect time to get searching for those summer vacation flights,\u201d said Naveen Dittakavi, CEO and co-founder of the flight deal website Next Vacay. \u201cAny closer than one month and you\u2019ll start to see those prices increase, or worse, they might sell out. However you can use the time in between to watch price trends and get an idea of what\u2019s a good price for your destination.\u201d\nRising inflation and fuel costs are already affecting the air travel industry, and experts are predicting airfare price hikes.\n\u201cBooking now versus later can mean locking in better prices,\u201d said Casey Brogan, a consumer travel expert at Tripadvisor. \u201cWaiting to book could mean you might pay more.\u201d\nOnly considering beaches\nRather than spending thousands on an East Coast beach house and sweating in the sand, consider crisp mountain air, said Phil Dengler, co-founder of The Vacationer.\n\u201cIt is a mistake to only consider traditional beach vacations for summer travel,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cEveryone wants to go to Myrtle Beach or Outer Banks during the summer, which is why I recommend considering other types of trips. If you like hiking, go to a traditional winter resort that offers skiing in a state like Colorado or Utah. While you will not be able to ski, there are countless mountains and other trails to hike as well as activities like mountain biking.\u201d\nIf you do opt for the beach route, pack your own sunscreen to avoid paying excessive markups and check to see if your hotel or rental provides complementary beach chairs, towels and umbrellas or if you\u2019ll have to pay daily fees for them.\n\u201cOver an entire week, you could end up paying hundreds of extra dollars for things you assumed were already included,\u201d Dengler said.\nBooking for peak times\n\u201cIt is a huge mistake to book summer travel during the peak season. That includes the Fourth of July to the middle of August,\u201d Dengler said.\nIn addition to crowd considerations, he noted that airfare, lodging and car rental prices are often at their highest during that time.\n\u201cInstead, you should book summer travel during the shoulder season,\u201d he said. \u201cFor summer, the shoulder season is a period where it is still warm enough to enjoy the heat and beach but where crowds are minimal and prices are lower. For most locations in the United States, this is the middle to the end of June and the middle of August to the second week in September. Many kids in the Southern states go back to school in early August, which means popular summer destinations will see fewer vacationers.\u201d\nMartin Jones, CEO of ParkSleepFly, advised against traveling to destinations during annual festivals and events if they aren\u2019t the purpose of your trip.\n\u201cMake sure you check the calendar before booking, as these events can cause a spike in prices and limit hotel availability,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in the events, then consider booking alternative dates.\u201d\nMissing travel benefits\n\u201cYou should check to see what travel benefits your credit card offers,\u201d Dengler said. \u201cEven nontravel cards may have valuable benefits. For example, the Chase Freedom Unlimited offers trip cancellation/interruption insurance, secondary rental car insurance, and travel and emergency assistance services.\u201d\nBefore racking up travel charges, make sure you aren\u2019t missing out on discounts or doubling up on services you already have access to for free.\nTravel blogger Rocky Trifari also suggested applying for additional services that can ease the chaos of summer travel if you can swing it.\n\u201cThe increase in volume translates into busier airports, longer lines and a greater need for advanced planning and making reservations ahead of time,\u201d Trifari told HuffPost. \u201cIf possible, I recommend applying for TSA PreCheck, Clear, Global Entry and any other optional services that can speed up how long it takes to get on and off airplanes to expedite how quickly you can get to and from your travel destinations \u2015 which is really where you want your time to be spent, not waiting around in the airport.\u201d\nPlanning a stressful itinerary\n\u201cA mistake people often make is trying to squeeze in every top attraction and landmark and fill every minute of their time with activities,\u201d Brogan said.\nThirty percent of U.S. travelers polled in a January Tripadvisor survey said it\u2019s more important now than before the pandemic that they \u201cpack as many activities\u201d into their holiday travel as possible.\n\u201cUnderstandably, travelers want to make the most of their vacations and make up for lost time,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cBut this can be a daunting and draining task, leaving no time for spontaneity. Instead, try booking local tours and guided cultural activities \u2015 those activities and tours where subject matter experts and professional guides allow for travelers to sit back, learn, relax and see all that an area has to offer. Enjoy all the top sites with none of the planning.\u201d\nBooking accommodations first\n\u201cPeople tend to lock in their dates by booking accommodation first, but there\u2019s little chance you\u2019ll find a good flight deal,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cYou\u2019re penning yourself in.\u201d\nHe recommended opening up your options by starting with a broader idea, such as \u201cI want to go to a beach destination\u201d or \u201cI want to go to Cancun, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica or the Bahamas.\u201d\nThen, find flight and hotel deals that fit the bill.\n\u201cIf you have a big group, airfare can really add up, so keep your options open and snag good deals when they come along,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cThen evaluate your options for accommodation. Rather than, \u2018I\u2019m going to Paris from July 5-12,\u2019 say, \u2018I\u2019m going to Europe sometime between late June and early August.\u2019 This gives you more room to find something unexpected that will surprise you.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ethical-travel-internationally-before-world-vaccinated_l_603bf048c5b6ff75ac3d209d": "Many Americans are longing for the days when they could take a dream vacation to Paris, Bali, or even just over the border to Toronto. As vaccine availability increases in the U.S., people are feeling a glimmer of hope that international travel will be back on the table soon.\nBut even as more people get vaccinated and countries open up to American tourists, traveling abroad may remain inadvisable for a time, especially to places with less widespread vaccine access. As we move forward and start planning trips again, there are important factors to consider before grabbing our passports and jetting off.\nHuffPost asked bioethicists, as well as public health and travel experts, to weigh in on the ethics of traveling abroad before vaccines have been widely administered worldwide. Read on for their thoughts.\nWe haven\u2019t ruled out transmission risk.\n\u201cIndividuals who are vaccinated have protection \u2015 although not 100% protection \u2015 against developing severe disease if infected with SARS-CoV-2,\u201d said Amy McGuire, professor of biomedical ethics and director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cHowever, we are still generating evidence of how well different vaccines protect against transmission of the virus.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that vaccinated travelers could still transmit the virus to others, so until we have more data on how much vaccines reduce transmission risk, we can\u2019t draw particularly meaningful conclusions about the ethics of travel in the coming weeks and months.\n\u201cIf someone in the U.S. travels to another country, they may have an asymptomatic infection that they bring with them to the other country, putting people there at risk,\u201d William Miller, senior associate dean for research at the Ohio State University\u2019s College of Public Health, told HuffPost in an email. \u201cOr they may acquire an infection there and bring it back with them to the people they are close to. The vaccinated traveler may not get sick but they may cause others to become sick \u2015 that\u2019s why, in general, it still is not a good idea to travel yet.\u201d\nVirus variants can be a cause for concern.\n\u201cOther countries may have higher rates of virus variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, may cause more severe disease,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe transmission of these variants to and from vaccinated people is a concerning possibility.\u201d\nAs we still have much to learn about new variants (like whether the currently approved vaccines protect against them and reduce their transmission), it\u2019s important to remain cautious and keep unnecessary travel to a minimum.\n\u201cTravelers may be infected with a novel variant and get sick, and potentially increase its spread in the U.S.,\u201d said Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, an assistant professor at Baylor\u2019s Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy.\nAll health care infrastructure is not created equal.\n\u201cPlease keep in mind that vaccine rollout in most countries is just getting started and they may not have COVID under control,\u201d L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz noted. \u201cTravelers could add more pressure to strained health care systems in other countries.\u201d\nCountries with minimal outbreaks can also be vulnerable, especially if they don\u2019t have the same health care and vaccination resources that wealthier nations do. A recent piece by James Hamblin in The Atlantic pointed to the disparities in vaccine access.\n\u201cVietnam, for example, is a country of 97 million people that has had fewer than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 and 35 deaths,\u201d Hamblin wrote. \u201cThey have done an exemplary job of controlling the virus, and presumably have very low levels of immunity.\u201d\nNicole Hassoun, a visiting scholar at Cornell University and professor of philosophy at Binghamton University who studies public health ethics, made a similar point to HuffPost.\n\u201cWhile most people in rich countries will probably have access to a vaccine this year, those in poor countries will likely have to wait years to get vaccinated,\u201d Hassoun said.\n\u201cHowever, poor countries might rely on the tourism international travel brings, and in some cases even do worse, all things considered, without it,\u201d she added. \u201cSo if you decide not to travel, you might consider finding other ways to support businesses and people in poor places this year. If nothing else, you might consider donating the money you would have used traveling for fun.\u201d\nThere\u2019s reason to be cautiously optimistic for the future.\nAs the number of vaccinated people increases worldwide, prospects for international travel may improve as well.\n\u201cAs vaccine rollout advances, there will be much less community transmission, less likelihood of infection, and less likelihood of novel variants emerging,\u201d L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz explained. \u201cThis will likely make tourism more manageable for host countries and greatly decrease the risk you may pose to others. At that point, you should feel more comfortable traveling to other countries.\u201d\nHigh vaccination rates and low COVID-19 rates, in both the traveler\u2019s destination and country of origin, may make travel possible again, assuming we learn the current vaccines provide lasting immunity and considerably reduce transmission rates.\n\u201cOne way to think about this is that you want to be in a fairly normal situation where your own local situation is open, with more or less normal activities albeit with masking and distancing,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd you want to be going to a place that is also fairly normal. And in both of those situations, you want rates low, despite the openness.\u201d\nIn this scenario, travel demand is likely to reach new heights, said Konrad Waliszewski, co-founder and CEO of the travel app Tripscout.\n\u201cOnce a high percentage of the world is vaccinated, prepare to witness the biggest travel boom the world has ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cPent-up demand from a year of lockdown, combined with a significant increase in remote work flexibility, a decrease in required business travel, and respect for the fact you never know when the world will shut down again, will cause people to travel like never before.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s imperative we continue to act with caution. The key to global travel will be making the vaccine accessible to as many people around the world as possible, and preventing the development and spread of new coronavirus variants.\n\u201cWe are currently in a race to get enough people vaccinated that we achieve herd immunity before new viral strains that are resistant to the vaccines emerge and spread,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cSo the answer to that question depends on how successful we are over the coming months at vaccinating large percentages of the population, while controlling the spread of new viral strains.\u201d\nThe answer may vary based on the destination.\nIf we\u2019re in a position to travel abroad this year, there will still be factors to consider when choosing a destination.\n\u201cI would look at how well the virus is being controlled in a certain destination, number of deaths and health care access,\u201d said Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of public health at New Mexico State University.\nIn addition to community transmission and health systems, Khubchandani advised taking into account the prevalence of new variants of the virus. Even if you are vaccinated, a country with a rapidly spreading variant is not the best place to visit, since we aren\u2019t yet sure how well the current vaccines protect against them. A country\u2019s vaccination rate will also affect the health care situation there.\n\u201cMany countries are heavily dependent on tourism and may allow travelers because it is such an important part of their economy, but that may not mean that they have COVID under control, and their health care system could be struggling,\u201d L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cThink of yourself as being a guest at a friend\u2019s house. If your friend was having some serious difficulty, and your presence at the house somehow added to that, you would not want to add more trouble.\u201d\nCheck the latest COVID stats on the State Department\u2019s website or elsewhere. Consider the public health measures that a given destination has in place. If there are strict lockdowns and quarantine requirements (likely for good reason), you probably won\u2019t be able to have the tourism experience you\u2019d prefer.\nStill, there are some international travel scenarios that could be lower-risk and doable this year. Just think about the impact of your travel on yourself, the people who live wherever you\u2019re going, and the ones you\u2019ll be returning home to.\nOne big consideration is \u201cwhether the visit will be spent mostly indoors or outdoors,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIf someone goes to a Caribbean island and will be spending all of their time outside, including when they are eating, and only spend time inside in their hotel room, then the risk would be very low. The same would be true of any vacation or trip where the activity is primarily outside \u2015 hiking and boating. But a trip with a focus indoors, like visiting museums, eating inside in restaurants, [and] visiting pubs, will have a higher risk.\u201d\nIf you do travel, take precautions.\nSome reasons for international travel are better than others \u2015 like an emergency, visiting a dying relative, or getting a rare treatment for a serious disease. Still, many people are choosing leisure travel, and that number will inevitably grow as vaccinations rates increase. If you decide to travel abroad, it\u2019s important to take the necessary health precautions to protect yourself and the people you\u2019ll encounter.\n\u201cYou have to be willing to follow the COVID preventive measures those countries have in place,\u201d L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cThis could include pre-travel COVID testing and wearing masks. Being a tourist does not mean local rules do not apply to you.\u201d\nKeep your distance from others, mask up and wash your hands. Follow public health measures, and make smart decisions as the situation evolves. Make sure your travel companions, and the businesses and lodgings you plan to visit, do the same.\n\u201cResearch and detailed trip planning is more important than ever,\u201d Waliszewski said. \u201cAmerican travelers must constantly stay up to date on rapidly changing situations on the ground and the corresponding guidelines in the States and abroad. Travelers must also consider testing and quarantine requirements, safety guidelines, and local health care infrastructure prior to departing for any destination. I don\u2019t see this sort of planning going away anytime soon, even after a high vaccination rate [is achieved].\u201d\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to remember that your personal health isn\u2019t the only thing that matters.\n\u201cIn this pandemic, we always have to consider how our behavior affects others,\u201d Miller emphasized. \u201cYour vaccination protects you, for sure, and it may protect others. But until we know for sure that it protects others by reducing transmission, we have to remain cautious.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/national-parks-best-winter-season_l_6374fab8e4b0283a8d16f867": "When people plan their national parks vacations, they typically don\u2019t target the winter season. But the low-traffic cooler months are actually a perfect time to visit many parks across the U.S.\n\u201cWinter is such an underrated time of year to visit the national parks if you\u2019re willing to put in some extra time planning around seasonal closures and packing those winter clothes,\u201d Jim Pattiz, co-founder of the organization More Than Just Parks, told HuffPost.\nOf course, some parks are better suited for winter visits than others. We asked experts to share the national parks they believe are best to explore during the winter season.\nSequoia National Park\n\u201cWithout a doubt my favorite national park to visit in the winter is Sequoia National Park in California,\u201d Pattiz said. \u201cWalking through a grove of the park\u2019s magnificent giant sequoias draped in feet of white snow is truly an awe-inspiring experience. The crowds and frequent wildfires of summer are long gone here and replaced by the serene quiet of snow dropping from overburdened branches and the wind gently passing through the giant trees\u2019 upper canopies.\u201d\nHe noted that many of the park\u2019s roads are closed seasonally, so it\u2019s important to check the website ahead of time to ensure you can reach the specific destinations you want to visit.\n\u201cBe flexible and bring your best winter clothing!\u201d Pattiz added.\nEverglades National Park\n\u201cSo many people make Florida their summer vacation spot because it\u2019s a convenient time for a family getaway. However, it is not a good time to visit Everglades National Park,\u201d said national parks travel expert Mikah Meyer.\nThis impressive wetlands ecosystem is located just outside Miami, and as Meyer alluded to, the area\u2019s summer heat, humidity and swarms of mosquitos make it less enjoyable to visit during that time of year compared to other months.\n\u201cHaving spent time in every section of the park in January, I can confirm it is an entirely different \u2015 and pleasant \u2015 experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lower temperatures make every activity more enjoyable, including it being more comfortable to wear long pants on a muddy \u2018slough slog\u2019 hike to a cypress dome.\u201d\nAirboat rides feel less blistering in the sun during this time of year, and there\u2019s a nice coolness in the air as you watch dolphins in the southwest section.\n\u201cIt also means you\u2019ll be less dehydrated during a Shark Valley Tram Tour, and in general will make you want to spend more time admiring the park\u2019s multitude of wildlife than rushing back to the AC of your car,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWhile there are other nearby national parks to Miami, Biscayne Bay and Dry Tortugas, both of these are less enjoyable in the winter because they are so heavily reliant upon water activities. The ocean water is cold during this time of year, which also takes away recreation options at the beach.\u201d\nYellowstone National Park\n\u201cYellowstone is one of the best parks to visit in the winter because it offers a unique glimpse at the world\u2019s first national park,\u201d said Jack Steward, co-host of the \u201cRock the Park\u201d TV series. \u201cThe park has a quieter, less active feel in the winter, and with the bears hibernating, you can really sense the stillness in the air.\u201d\nThe winter provides rare opportunities for exploration with fewer crowds and incredible snowy vistas, creating the sense that you\u2019re the only people in the vast landscape.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t drive through or [camp] inside the park in winter,\u201d said Joe Yogerst, travel expert and author of National Geographic\u2019s \u201c50 States, 500 Campgrounds.\u201d \u201cBut you can hop a snowcoach or snowmobile tour or join a guided snowshoe or cross-country ski trip in the parks. There\u2019s nothing quite like seeing \u2015 and photographing \u2015 a herd of snow-mantled bison in Yellowstone.\u201d\nMake sure you do your research, so you know how you\u2019ll be getting around and which areas are accessible during the winter. You\u2019ll be mentally and logistically prepared for a unique experience.\n\u201cMammoth Hot Springs and the Lamar Valley are two locations that must be visited, both for the wildlife and to see the transformative nature of winter,\u201d Derek Wright and Amy Beth Wright, outdoor enthusiasts and creators of Parks and Points, told HuffPost in an email. \u201cOld Faithful blasts out steaming water, but then watch as it cools in the winter air. Ghost trees (trees covered with the frozen water spray), geysers where water turns from steam to ice, and bison whose exhales come with wisps of steam as well are just a few images of the natural world that are only visible at this time of year.\u201d\nAlthough camping outdoors isn\u2019t an option, they recommended exploring the lodging options inside and outside the park, like the gateway towns of West Yellowstone and Gardiner.\n\u201cIt is cold, but pack warm clothes and enjoy a hot cocoa at the end of the day, as you\u2019ll never have a winter adventure quite like this,\u201d the Wrights added.\nBig Bend National Park\n\u201cBig Bend National Park in West Texas is a massive park that borders the Rio Grande River and Mexico, and makes for a great winter visit,\u201d the Wrights said. \u201cThe summer temperatures will have abated, making it a perfect time to hike or stroll through a unique mountain landscape that formed from volcanic activity 35 million years ago.\u201d\nWinter is part of the park\u2019s high season, so make sure you plan ahead if you want to camp or stay at the lodge.\n\u201cIn particular, skygazing is perfect at this time of year,\u201d the Wrights noted. \u201cIf you are into astral photography or simply enjoy being absorbed by the night sky in an amazing location, Big Bend National Park is an official International Dark Sky Park. With the timing of winter sunsets, stargazing can start before 8:00 p.m.\u201d\nTravel blogger Renee Hahnel also advised taking advantage of the winter weather conditions in southwest Texas.\n\u201cIt can get really hot in Big Bend National Park, so visiting during winter is optimal,\u201d Hahnel said. \u201cThere\u2019s tons to do, including hiking, sightseeing, bouldering, scenic drives, and soaking in hot springs.\u201d\nBryce Canyon National Park\n\u201cThe hoodoo-spired landscape of Bryce Canyon National Park adds another dimension entirely when snow falls on its peaks,\u201d said James Brockbank, founder of The Family Vacation Guide.\nBeyond the magical vibes, you won\u2019t have to contend with crowds and struggle to find parking during the low winter season, and there are still plenty of activity options.\n\u201cThe red rock amphitheater remains open year-round, and families can head to popular lookouts such as Sunset Point or hike recommended routes including the Navajo Loop and Queen\u2019s Garden trails,\u201d Brockbank said. \u201cThere are a multitude of things to do \u2015 from daytime hiking, ice fishing and snowmobiling to a nightfall stargazing and camping experience for families. Its photogenic landscape makes for a great excuse for sightseeing and plenty of photo opportunities to cherish for life.\u201d\nAcadia National Park\n\u201cAcadia National Park is typically covered in 5 feet of blanketed snow during the colder months,\u201d Brockbank said. \u201cThe park contains the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the U.S. Great for cross-country skiers that can enjoy a 45-mile stretch of carriage roads.\u201d\nParkgoers can grab a hot chocolate and explore the nearby Mount Desert Island town of Bar Harbor, Maine, before and after their Acadia adventures.\n\u201cThe park is rich in human history dating back 10,000 years,\u201d Brockbank said. \u201cHere you can include your kids of all ages, as there are a plethora of child-friendly excursions for educational purposes along with fun-filled activities.\u201d\nFrom snowshoeing to snowmobiling to ice fishing, the options are vast.\nDeath Valley National Park\n\u201cWinter is the prime time to visit Death Valley National Park,\u201d said Janel Jensen, program manager for adventure travel at REI. \u201cTemperatures are usually mild (for the \u2018hottest place on Earth\u2019), and there are good opportunities to still soak up some sun.\u201d\nThe snow-capped peaks and low-angled winter light make for some lovely views, and you can spend more time outdoors than is advisable during the hotter months.\n\u201cHiking is an ideal activity along with cycling the less-trafficked roads during offseason,\u201d Jensen said.\nYosemite National Park\n\u201cMy favorite winter national park is Yosemite, mainly because the valley and the high Sierra look so gorgeous when covered in snow,\u201d Yogerst said.\nHe recommended snowy activities like snowshoeing through the redwood groves, family-style downhill skiing or snowboarding at Badger Pass, ice skating beneath the stars at Curry Village, and cross-country skiing along Glacier Point Road.\n\u201cYosemite National Park is one of the busiest national parks during the warmer months, so visiting during winter is a great time to escape the crowds,\u201d Hahnel said. \u201cI recommend traveling with tire chains, unless you have a 4x4 vehicle and winter tires. The roads can get icy!\u201d\nPhotography enthusiasts will also enjoy the season\u2019s low lighting and easy wildlife spotting, added Jensen.\n\u201cYosemite National Park is a winter wonderland of iced granite peaks, snow-topped giant sequoias and snow blanketing the valley floor,\u201d she said. \u201cMy favorite snowshoe trip is from Badger Pass to Dewey Point, where you are rewarded with one of the best views of the valley and El Captan and Half Dome on a clear day.\u201d\nZion National Park\n\u201cWinters in Zion National Park are spectacular,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThe potential fresh snow on the landscape adds a dramatic contrast to the already unique scenery and the noise-dampening quality of snow makes this less crowded season that much more peaceful.\u201d\nShe touted the crowd-free solitude of Zion in the winter and variety of hiking options open year-round due to the low elevation and mild conditions.\n\u201cTake in breathtaking views of snow-dusted cliffs contrasted against the warm orange tones of Zion Canyon,\u201d Jensen recommended. \u201cHike to Observation Point, exploring slot canyons along the way and incredible views of iconic Angels Landing. It\u2019s easier to see wildlife this time of year as they move to lower elevation. Wild turkeys, bald eagles, elk and bighorn sheep are a few of the resident wildlife.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-sites-to-airbnb-for-vacation-rentals_n_5a987ab9e4b0a0ba4ad184e9": "HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

While the former is generally the simplest way to book a trip, some people prefer to buy two separate one-way tickets when they travel.\nBut are there good reasons to choose one over the other? We asked a few travel experts to share their advice on whether it\u2019s better to book two one-ways or a round-trip reservation for your next air travel excursion.\nInternational travel tends to incentivize round-trip bookings.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re booking international flights, it almost always pays off to book as a round-trip, since airlines typically price one-ways at much more than half the cost of the round-trip fare,\u201d said Zach Griff, senior reporter at The Points Guy.\nIndeed, a cursory search on Google Flights while writing this piece found a round-trip flight option from New York to Paris for $522. But if you were to purchase the same two flights separately \u2015 New York to Paris, then Paris back to New York \u2015 the combined cost would be $1,670, more than three times the cost of the round-trip booking. The price discrepancy can get even more egregious when premium cabin fares are involved.\n\u201cIn general, round-trip tickets tend to be cheaper than two one-way tickets, particularly if you intend on flying with a single carrier or alliance,\u201d said Willis Orlando, senior product operations specialist at Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights.\nSo if you\u2019re all about airline loyalty, you\u2019ll likely find better pricing options booking a round-trip journey for your international travels.\nBut domestic flights have better one-way pricing.\nWhile airline pricing tends to incentivize round-trip bookings for international flights, there isn\u2019t as much of a disparity with domestic air travel.\n\u201cWhen traveling within the U.S., airlines typically price one-way flights at exactly half the cost of a round-trip,\u201d reporter Chris Dong wrote for The Points Guy in September. \u201cThere certainly are exceptions, especially for those that fly out of smaller, regional airports.\u201d\nThus, if you\u2019re flying domestically out of a major hub, you have better odds of finding good deals on separate one-way tickets.\nBooking separate legs allows you to combine airlines.\nOnce you\u2019ve determined you won\u2019t lose money booking separate legs for your air travel, consider why you want to do it this way.\n\u201cBooking a round-trip itinerary as two one-way segments can make sense in some cases,\u201d Griff said. \u201cFor one, it gives you the flexibility to choose between more than one airline in your searches. Sometimes, you can save money by combining flights on different airlines.\u201d\nPerhaps you have rewards points with two different airlines that service your destination and want to cash them in during one trip. Booking separately allows you to do that. You might even find a good deal for the outbound part of your journey with one airline and for the return flight with a different carrier.\n\u201cThat said, you\u2019ll need to pay attention to different fare rules when combining two airlines on one trip,\u201d Griff noted. \u201cFor instance, if your outbound flight is delayed or canceled, you\u2019d only be entitled to a refund for that portion of the itinerary, if you booked as one-ways.\u201d\nOne-ways also offer more flexibility with return dates.\nAnother factor you may want to consider when booking round-trip or one-way is how sure you are of your dates.\nGood one-way rates \u201ccan be useful if you\u2019re not quite sure when you\u2019ll be returning from your trip, which is particularly relevant in the age of remote work and extended AirBnB stays,\u201d Orlando said.\nSo if you aren\u2019t exactly sure when you\u2019ll be ending your stay, you can make the process easier by simply booking a one-way ticket there. Then you don\u2019t have to book your return until you\u2019re ready, and you won\u2019t have to spend time changing it to a later date over and over again.\nOrlando said he\u2019s even had some luck booking one-ways internationally with certain carriers, like TAP Air Portugal.\n\u201cI frequently travel to Europe for weeks, if not months, at a time, and try to make sure I end my trip in a city served by TAP, because I know I\u2019ll be able to find myself a cheap one-way ticket home,\u201d he noted.\nBooking separate legs might help with a complicated itinerary.\nSometimes your travels might take you to multiple places and via different transit methods. For example, you might fly from Miami to New York and then take the train down to Washington, D.C. In this case, you\u2019d want to fly back home from a different city than the one you flew into.\n\u201cIn many cases, it will be possible to book an open-jaw ticket, coupling the two itineraries into a single \u2018round-trip\u2019 ticket, but occasionally that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cIn that case, it can be worthwhile to look into one-way prices to see if they offer a competitive price, or favorable routing.\u201d\nWhen you have a more complex itinerary, it might feel simpler to break it up into one-way flights. Just make sure to compare the prices, and be prepared to manage the different airline bookings in your inbox.\nAs with most aspects of travel, there\u2019s no one magic way to do things when you\u2019re deciding whether to book two one-ways or a round-trip journey. But with research and experience, you can get better at figuring out what works best for your budget, itinerary and overall comfort level.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-make-friends-while-traveling-solo_l_5d9249e7e4b0ac3cddacf13d": "Along with taking in the beautiful sights, tasting the local cuisine and immersing yourself in the culture, meeting new people is one of the most exciting and enriching parts of travel.\nBut for some, making friends as an adult can be an awkward, uncomfortable and, quite frankly, scary undertaking.\n\u201cAs a former introvert-turned-extrovert thanks to solo travel, I understand that striking up a conversation, or figuring out where to meet people to hang with, might be a little difficult and anxiety-driving,\u201d Alyssa Ramos, blogger at My Life\u2019s A Travel Movie, told HuffPost. \u201cTrust me, it took years for me to build up the balls to hang at hostels or bars by myself.\u201d\nWe asked Ramos and other solo travelers for their best tips to safely meet new people \u2014 locals or fellow wanderers \u2014 during a trip so you can make the most of the experience.

But if you feel unsafe, know it\u2019s OK to find somewhere else to stay\n\u201cMost of the friends I have met on the road, I\u2019ve met while staying in hostels. It is probably the most tried-and-true way of making friendships while on the road. With that said, I found on some occasions hostels were a bit isolating for me as a black woman. I wouldn\u2019t swear them off, but I would encourage being comfortable enough to leave a hostel if you ever feel uneasy. This applies to any situation that may cause you to feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve done this a bunch of times and always ended up in a better environment with accepting people.\u201d \u2014 Cherez\n3. And if you\u2019re a woman, you might want to choose a female-only hostel dorm.\n\u201cI tend to feel a lot safer in such rooms, and they\u2019re generally cleaner, calmer and more communal. There\u2019s also a higher chance to meet other solo female travelers or female friends who are traveling in small groups who you can connect with and plan a day\u2019s itinerary with. Some of my most memorable and fascinating solo travel friendships came out of these rooms.\u201d \u2015 Atikah Amalina, The Tudung Traveller\n4. Sit in public or common areas when you\u2019re reading, journaling, eating or having coffee.\n\u201cTo make new connections with new people, you have to make yourself available to be connected with. This can be done by just having a coffee at a local coffee shop, reading down in the hotel lounge or eating in the hostel communal kitchen. I have made a lot of friends this way. It starts with a friendly smile, then a conversation and next thing you know, you are road-tripping with them two years later when they come to visit you. Now you know that people that sit in social areas often wouldn\u2019t mind making a new friend either.\u201d \u2015 Eamon Wood of the Wayward Wheeler\n5. Don\u2019t be afraid to invite someone to join you for an activity or ask if you can tag along with them.\n\u201cFollow your instincts and be a \u2018yes\u2019 person. Say yes to an invite, say yes to inviting someone. I know not everyone is extroverted \u2014 myself included \u2014 but saying yes opens up a wonderful amount of experiences and connections.\u201d \u2014 Wood\n6. Take a class in something you already love to do.\n\u201cDo you like to dance? Are you into yoga? If so, this is an entertaining (and safe) way to meet new people interested in doing things you like to do. You can easily find out by googling \u2018salsa classes\u2019 or \u2018yoga classes\u2019 or by keeping an eye out for signs on bulletin boards in coffee shops or posted in the windows of businesses. You could ask around at any bars or coffee shops about salsa nights at lounges or bars in the area. You can also put out feelers in a Facebook group dedicated to the country you are in.\u201d \u2015 Cherez\n7. Or get out of your comfort zone by trying a new activity.\n\u201cWhen you feel safe in a destination, part of the joy of traveling is to get out and try new things and discover new interests, people or places. Booking a plane ticket and going somewhere new is the first step, but don\u2019t just exhaust yourself and stay alone in your hotel or hostel. Go to the hostel bar alone, go to a drag show and meet the performers (that\u2019s one of my top LGBTQ travel tips, actually), join a bungee-jumping excursion or try something new.\u201d \u2014 Adam Groffman of Travels of Adam\n8. Go on a walking tour of the city or town.\n\u201cWalking tours are usually tip-based, advertised heavily and the best way to be introduced to a new place. Hence many travelers turn up to these at the same time! Make the most of this and you\u2019ll be able to easily strike up small talk with the other tourists as you go around. Why not suggest doing something together after and taking it from there?\u201d \u2014 Alice Teacake of Teacake Travels\n9. Find out where other travelers hang out.\n\u201cI backpacked solo across Asia for eight months, and every country I went to had a mecca of sorts for travelers. For example, in Bangkok, if you\u2019re looking for travel buddies, head down to Khao San Road, or if you\u2019re in Kathmandu, check out the bars in Central Thamel. How to determine where these magical spots are hiding? Easy. Snag a copy of the most recent Lonely Planet guidebook for that city or country. They are incredibly accurate about these things and full of other useful tips \u2014 I get one for every new country I go to.\u201d \u2014 Crosthwaite\n10. Or figure out where the locals go.\n\u201cMy favorite way to do this is by talking to local taxi drivers, shop owners, my hostel or Airbnb host or just by wandering around. Especially when in more remote places, it\u2019s highly likely that someone will ask you where you\u2019re from and the conversation will go from there \u2014 often one that will lead you to the best local sights, stories, and maybe even gain you a new friend.\u201d \u2014 Crosthwaite\n11. Use an app like Tourlina to connect with other female travelers.\n\u201cLooking for awesome women to hang out with if you\u2019re a solo female traveler? Tourlina is just like Tinder, but only for making friends who are local or traveling too! You can see if you have similar interests, match, then take it from there.\u201d \u2015 Teacake\n12. Sign up for a nightlife tour.\n\u201cThis allows me to have a drink or two with a group of people and better scope out my surroundings to see where I feel safe and comfortable. It\u2019s also easy to make new friends on the tour who\u2019ll let you accompany them after the official program ends.\u201d \u2014 Jen Ruiz of Jen on a Jet Plane\n13. Volunteer to give back to the local community.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re traveling for one week or one year, volunteering is the perfect way to use your skills while also making an impact. It not only gives you a better understanding of the culture, but it also connects you with other travelers who share similar values!\nSign up in advance on a website like Workaway and explore opportunities available in the countries you\u2019ll be visiting. During my year in Latin America, I volunteered in earthquake relief and with children in after-school programs. I met one of my closest friends when we both worked at a summer camp in Quito, Ecuador. We lived together for three weeks, and when the program was over, traveled onward for nine weeks in Colombia.\u201d \u2014 Asia Dawn Simonelli\n14. Use dating apps safely and wisely.\n\u201cI know I know, using dating apps to meet people abroad while you\u2019re traveling solo may not sound \u2018cool\u2019 or safe. But I\u2019ve used them with good intentions and in smart ways numerous times, and have ended up getting awesome insider tips and tours, tons of new friends (both locals and travelers), and even some make-shift photographers!\n\u201cI usually use Tinder because it\u2019s the most universal dating app, and I make sure to write on my bio something like, \u2018World traveler looking to hear insights, tips and stories from locals or other travelers!\u2019 Of course, with the casual disclaimer, \u2018NOT LOOKING FOR HOOK UPS\u2019 at the end, and maybe a shout out to my Instagram.\u201d \u2015 Ramos\n... And if you do decide to meet someone from an app IRL, choose a public place.\n\u201cAs a gay man, I\u2019ve used Grindr when traveling to get a tour from a local of Manchester, England\u2019s gayborhood; in Amman, Jordan, I used it to get a recommendation for an LGBTQ hotspot in the city; and in Prague, I used it to make a friend to visit the Pride parade with! Just use caution and make sure to meet new people in public places as often as possible, trust your instincts and feel free to always say no.\u201d \u2014 Groffman\nResponses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/6-breathtaking-destinations-with-no-cell-service_b_5a7a00f5e4b01109985cd8d1": "Ignore your Insta, sign out of Facebook and turn on your out-of-office, because it\u2019s time for a real vacation, sans cell phone. From an African safari to a private beachside bungalow, you can search high and low, but you won\u2019t find a single bar of signal at these properties \u2014 making them some of our favorite resorts and vacation rentals for true digital detox.\n1. Hacienda AltaGracia (P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n, Costa Rica)\nHacienda AltaGracia \u2014 a lush boutique hotel in the P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n southern region of Costa Rica \u2014 first opened in 2011 as a remote family retreat and coffee farm. The property, featuring 50 hacienda-style casitas, may have gotten a luxe makeover when Auberge took it over in 2015, but it hasn\u2019t lost its authentic, off-the-beaten-path vibe. With a top-notch spa, an on-site equestrian program and wildlife refuge excursions, guests won\u2019t mind the spotty cell service. Three cheers for upping your nature game, and giving HQ Trivia a rest for a week (\u2026but there is free Wi-Fi\u2026shhh).\n2. Death Valley House (Beatty, Nevada)\nThis 1,200-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bath house set on 80 acres of land is the ultimate middle-of-nowhere rental getaway in the Nevada High Desert. Sure, it\u2019s isolated and miles from any infrastructure, but what it lacks in modern communication options (satellite wireless is your only option) it makes up for in upscale amenities: a large open kitchen, a barbecue, an indoor/outdoor living room and a spacious deck with a sunken-in hot tub, to name a few. Yep, this might just be the place to write the next great American novel.\n3. Morukuru Family (Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa)\nIf a tech-free African safari is on your bucket list, look no further than Morukuru Family. A four-hour drive from Johannesburg, this secluded Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux property is situated in the 75,000-hectare Madikwe Game Reserve, a Big Five reserve \u2014 and a hidden gem \u2014 in the northwest part of the country bordering Botswana. Head out during the day to see leopards, lions, elephants, rhinos and hundreds of different bird species before tucking into one of three private luxury (and we mean luxury) houses on the property, each with expansive decks, fireplaces, indoor and outdoor dining and baths, and private swimming pools.\n4. Hotel Remota (Puerto Natales, Chile)\nIt\u2019s no surprise that wildlife and nature lovers are drawn to this secluded South American hideaway. Guests won\u2019t mind swapping televisions and other electronics for sweeping views of the incredible Patagonian landscape with its fjords, glaciers, forests and waterfalls. The 72-room lodge itself is sustainable and modern and elegant in design with an infinity pool, hot tubs, a bar and a restaurant featuring local seafood and farm-fresh produce. Sounds like you won\u2019t really even have time to Netflix and chill here.\n5. The Fox Den Cabin (Seward, Alaska)\nThis one-bedroom, one-bath cabin is so tucked away that guests can arrive only by \u2014 wait for it \u2014 helicopter or boat (mic drop). Fifteen miles outside Seward on Resurrection Bay, the Fox Den is a secluded respite from everyday life. Leave your phone behind and enjoy the sublime views of the 49th state\u2019s wildlife. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even spot some whales swimming in the bay from the cedar sundeck.\n6. Blackbird Caye Resort (Turneffe Atoll, Belize)\nIn an area known for diving, this idyllic resort is said to have some of the best. Guests can also snorkel, kayak, fish or just relax in one of the many screened-in balconies or hammocks facing the Caribbean Sea. Thatched-roof cottages and private oceanfront cabanas are the norm at this all-inclusive resort, which offers excellent service and plenty of privacy. That said, what Blackbird Caye doesn\u2019t have is cell service\u2026 or reliable Wi-Fi.

But the chaos of air travel this summer has thrown cold water on that confidence.\nThe odds of airlines losing your luggage have reportedly \u201cskyrocketed\u201d this year, with massive increases in the numbers of \u201cmishandled\u201d \u2015 i.e., lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered \u2015 bags.\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, many airports and airlines were forced to reduce their workforce in reaction to the restrictions the world was facing,\u201d Alex Miller, founder and CEO of Upgraded Points, told HuffPost. \u201cNow, as these restrictions have been lifted, people are returning to their travels again, leaving airports and airlines struggling to cope with the surge of passengers. This combination of an increased demand, with a shortage of staff, as recruitment hasn\u2019t been able to counterbalance the increase, is leaving many travelers to arrive at their destination without their luggage.\u201d\nThe result is countless airport photos showing mounds of lost luggage and a lot of frustrated travelers.\nOf course, the obvious solution is to pack less and avoid checking a bag, but sometimes that\u2019s just not an option. So what should you do if you find yourself in this situation and end up separated from your bag? Below, experts share their advice.\nFile a missing bag report.\n\u201cThe first thing you should do if you notice that your baggage did not arrive at your destination is to report it immediately,\u201d Miller advised. \u201cThe airline that you flew on is responsible for ensuring your luggage is delivered to your destination.\u201d\nGo to the airline\u2019s baggage desk and have the customer service representative see if they can locate your luggage. It\u2019s possible it was delayed but will arrive on a later flight. Or perhaps it arrived early and was placed in a separate area.\nYou might also be able to determine your bag\u2019s location on the airline\u2019s mobile app. If the bag is still missing, however, it\u2019s time to file a claim.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve informed airline staff about your missing baggage, it is essential that you file a missing baggage report,\u201d Miller added. \u201cYou should provide a detailed description of your luggage, including size, color and material of the bag. The report should also include your current address and contact information so the airline can contact you. You should also keep a note of any reference or tracking number that you receive from the lost luggage desk.\u201d\nFind out what compensation you\u2019re owed.\n\u201cImmediately filing a missing bag report with the airline will both prompt them to begin searching for your bag and start the clock for when you\u2019ll be able to claim compensation,\u201d noted Scott Keyes, author of \u201cTake More Vacations\u201d and founder of Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights. \u201cIf it\u2019s been missing for between five to 14 days, at that point you\u2019re entitled to reimbursement of the missing bag and its contents, up to $3,800 for domestic flights and $1,780 for international flights.\u201d\nIn addition to talking to the airline, he recommended checking to see if your credit card offers any compensation for delayed or lost baggage as well.\n\u201cMany automatically include this, as long as you used it to pay for the flight,\u201d Keyes noted.\nIf you have travel insurance, read through all the terms regarding luggage.\n\u201cTravel insurance policies often include coverage for any lost or missing baggage,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAfter you have filed a claim with the airline, always double check for any additional claims that can be made on your insurance.\u201d\nKeep all receipts.\nLost luggage not only disrupts vacation plans by stranding people without the belongings they packed, but it also forces travelers to spend money on new things so that they don\u2019t have to repeatedly rewear their flight outfit or forego toothbrushing for days on end.\nThe good news is you may be entitled to reimbursement \u2015 so long as your purchases are \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\u201cKeep receipts for any daily purchases you had to make as a result of the missing bag,\u201d Keyes advised. \u201cThis may include clothes, toiletries or other daily items.\u201d\nFile a complaint if necessary.\n\u201cIf the airline is dragging its feet on providing compensation for a missing bag, don\u2019t be afraid to file a complaint with the federal Department of Transportation,\u201d Keyes said.\nThe agency\u2019s \u201cAir Travel Service Complaint or Comment Form\u201d allows travelers to flag bad airline service as it relates to baggage, as well as other issues, like refund practices, discrimination, overbooking, family seating and more.\nYou might also try getting the airline\u2019s attention through social media. Sometimes tweeting at the company or sending a direct message yields real results.\nStay optimistic\nAs frustrating as it is to be separated from your luggage, there are mechanisms in place to get it back to you.\nWhen staffing shortages at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport led to mass cancellations and a sea of stranded bags, Delta Air Lines flew a plane from London to Detroit packed with 1,000 pieces of luggage and zero passengers.\nTravel experts are also hopeful for the future of flying with checked baggage.\n\u201cThis problem will likely persist throughout the summer and then improve around Labor Day,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cThat\u2019s because travel demand is at its peak through mid-August and only begins to taper off once school begins again in parts of the country. It\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing nearly as many lost bags come autumn.\u201d\nTry to minimize the risk\n\u201cThere are a few proactive steps you can take to avoid lost luggage in the first place \u2015 setting aside the most obvious advice of avoiding checking a bag if you can,\u201d Keyes said.\nConsider the advice below to minimize your risk of winding up on vacation or back home from a trip without your things:\nPrioritize nonstop flights.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t booked a flight yet, prioritize nonstop flights or at least flights that don\u2019t have tight connections,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cThat transfer between airplanes is the place in the system where bags are most likely to get lost.\u201d\nAvoid flying with multiple airlines if possible as well. Sometimes it\u2019s cheaper to map out multiple stops and transfers, but weigh the costs compared to the risk of losing your luggage.\nGet to the airport extra early.\n\u201cAt the airport, try to arrive early \u2015 90 minutes or more before your flight time, more for international flights \u2015 to ensure your bag has plenty of time to make it onboard,\u201d Keyes said.\nEven if you aren\u2019t checking a bag, getting to the airport early is important these days, as there have been countless reports of security lines that stretch out the door. Having that extra buffer of time will cut down on stress as you wait in long, slow lines.\nUse trackers.\n\u201cIf you have a GPS tracker, like Apple\u2019s AirTags, throw one in so you can keep easy tabs on where your bag is, especially if it gets lost,\u201d Keyes advised.\nIndeed, Airtags have become one of this summer\u2019s most popular travel accessories. But be sure to use this product only for its intended purpose \u2015 tracking items, not people.\nTake a photo of your bag.\n\u201cBefore handing over your bag, open it up and take a quick picture with your camera phone,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cThat way, if the bag does end up getting lost, you\u2019ll have photographic proof of any important contents that you\u2019ll want to later claim compensation for.\u201d\nTake a photo of the outside of the bag as well. Make sure the tag the airline prints has the correct airport code, name and frequent flyer number, and take a picture of that. And don\u2019t forget to hold on to any receipts.\nPack any valuables in your carry-on.\n\u201cValuables and necessities should be packed in your carry-on,\u201d Miller said. \u201cItems such as physical cash, medication, electronics, jewelry and anything important to you should be carried with you at all times. Most airlines do not take responsibility for such items and will not issue reimbursements for them, so just avoid packing them into your checked baggage entirely to be on the safe side.\u201d\nMake sure to pack toiletries and at least one outfit and pair of underwear in your carry-on as well. It\u2019s better to be prepared than end up wearing the same clothes again if your suitcase gets lost.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mexico-popocatepetl-volcano_n_646794e9e4b06749be137628": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico\u2019s Popocatepetl volcano rumbled to life again this week, belching out towering clouds of ash that forced 11 villages to cancel school sessions.\nThe residents weren\u2019t the only ones keeping a close eye on the towering peak. Every time there is a sigh, tic or heave in Popocatepetl, there are dozens of scientists, a network of sensors and cameras, and a roomful of powerful equipment watching its every move.\nThe 17,797-foot volcano, known affectionately as \u201cEl Popo,\u201d has been spewing toxic fumes, ash and lumps of incandescent rock persistently for almost 30 years, since it awakened from a long slumber in 1994.\nThe volcano is 45 miles southeast of Mexico City, but looms much closer to the eastern fringes of the metropolitan area of 22 million people. The city also faces threats from earthquakes and sinking soil, but the volcano is the most visible potential danger \u2014 and the most closely watched. A severe eruption could cut off air traffic, or smother the city in clouds of choking ash.\nRinged around its summit are six cameras, a thermal imaging device and 12 seismological monitoring stations that operate 24 hours a day, all reporting back to an equipment-filled command center in Mexico City.\nA total of 13 scientists from a multidisciplinary team take turns staffing the command center around the clock. Being able to warn of an impending ash cloud is key, because people can take precautions. Unlike earthquakes, warning times can be longer for the volcano and in general the peak is more predictable.\nOn a recent day, researcher Paulino Alonso made the rounds, checking the readings at the command center run by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center, known by its initials as Cenapred. It is a complex task that involves seismographs that measure the volcano\u2019s internal trembling, which could indicate hot rock and gas moving up the vents in the peak.\nMonitoring gases in nearby springs and at the peak \u2014 and wind patterns that help determine where the ash could be blown \u2014 also play a role.\nThe forces inside are so great that they can temporarily deform the peak, so cameras and sensors must monitor the very shape of the volcano.\nHow do you explain all of this to 25 million non-experts living within a 62-mile radius who have grown so used to living near the volcano?\nAuthorities came up with the simple idea of a volcano \u201cstoplight\u201d with three colors: green for safety, yellow for alert and red for danger.\nFor most of the years since the stoplight was introduced, it has been stuck at some stage of \u201cyellow.\u201d The mountain sometimes quiets down, but not for long. It seldom shoots up molten lava: instead it\u2019s more the \u201cexplosive\u201d type, showering out hot rocks that tumble down its flanks and emitting bursts of gas and ash.\nThe center also has monitors in other states; Mexico is a country all too familiar with natural disasters.\nFor example, Mexico\u2019s earthquake early alert system is also based at the command center. Because the city\u2019s soil is so soft \u2014 it was built on a former lake bed \u2014 a quake hundreds of miles away on the Pacific coast can cause huge destruction in the capital, as happened in 1985 and 2017.\nA system of seismic monitors along the coast sends messages that race faster than the quake\u2019s shock waves. Once the sirens start blaring, it can give Mexico City residents up to half a minute to get to safety, usually on the streets outside.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/europe-winter-heat-wave-2023_n_63b378f6e4b0fe267caa8a7a": "A historic winter heat wave sent temperatures soaring in parts of Europe over New Year\u2019s weekend.\nThe Washington Post reports that thousands of temperature records were broken on the continent from Saturday to Monday, and on New Year\u2019s Day alone, at least seven countries experienced the warmest January weather on record.\nThose balmy temperatures included 67.3 degrees (19.6 Celsius) in the Czech Republic, 66.2 (19.0) in Poland and 62.4 (16.9 Celsius) in the Netherlands, according to the newspaper.

People have strong opinions about cruises, so whether there are disease outbreaks, reports of assault or deadly accidents, these events tend to garner a lot of attention.\nDespite these stories, cruise expert Stewart Chiron aka \u201cThe Cruise Guy,\u201d emphasized that such occurrences are overall rare when you look at the large number of cruise voyages and passengers that enjoy incident-free experiences each year.\n\u201cIt is in the interest of all the ships to provide as safe an environment and experience as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, there are bad situations that occur, but it\u2019s far fewer than what we would see ashore.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing that suggests that all cruises are unsafe,\u201d echoed Dr. Mark Fischer, regional medical director of International SOS. \u201cDangerous situations can happen anywhere at any time, and this includes on cruise ships.\u201d\nStill, he added, there are always unique health and safety risks when you embark on any travel journey, so it\u2019s important to stay vigilant.\n\u201cAccording to the CDC, the most common health threats to cruise passengers include norovirus, seasickness and respiratory illnesses,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cSome of the most common safety threats include extreme weather and petty crime. There are some things out of a traveler\u2019s control when on a cruise ship. However, there are also important guidelines a traveler can put into place to ensure safety.\u201d\nBelow, experts share their advice for prioritizing health and safety during a cruise vacation, from pre-travel procedures to tips for port excursions.\nPay attention to safety drills.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, remember to pay attention during the mandatory muster drill,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cThis is where you will learn where the life jackets are, what alarms mean, and what to do during certain emergencies. You should practice this drill a few hours after the instruction to ensure you retain the information.\u201d\nPay particular attention to the emergency signal, which typically consists of seven or more short blasts of the horn followed by one long blast. You can find recordings online to familiarize yourself with the sound.\nAnanias, now senior vice president of International Cruise Victims, recalled hearing the signal on the day of the Costa Concordia disaster. She and her family narrowly survived amid the chaos and confusion. \u201cThere were so many people from different countries, so they had to do five announcements in different languages from the PA system,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful to know the signal since there can be language barriers or the PA system might stop working.\u201d\nBe on alert when visiting ports.\n\u201cIf guests are wandering off the boat at a port, they should be aware of any safety concerns such as scams to avoid or pickpockets,\u201d said Cathy Pedrayes, a safety expert and author of \u201cThe Mom Friend Guide to Everyday Safety and Security.\u201d \u201cThe cruise ship can probably advise on any safety concerns specific to the area. And if you\u2019re touring at a port, remove the obvious markers that you\u2019re a tourist, such as a cruise ship ID bracelet unless required as part of a group tour.\u201d\nBefore you disembark to explore a port, consider paring down your wallet to just one or two credit cards, especially if you\u2019re traveling with a partner who has cards connected to the same accounts. That way, you\u2019ll minimize the consequences of falling victim to theft.\n\u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t consider that they\u2019re traveling internationally on the cruise because they departed from a U.S. port,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cObviously, you want to have a great time, but you still need to have your wits about you. Tourists are targets. Make sure your purse is zipped. Don\u2019t wear your flashiest jewelry and watches. And don\u2019t leave your belongings on the beach unattended.\u201d\nHe also recommended checking the latest news and State Department alerts for the destinations where the ship will be stopping. If reports of heightened crime make you uncomfortable, don\u2019t feel pressured to disembark at that particular stop, or at least be extra vigilant.\n\u201cIf something does happen at a port, say you get in a traffic accident in a remote area or wind up delayed on a tour you booked with someone other than the cruise line\u2019s designated company, make sure you contact your carrier,\u201d said travel safety consultant Kevin Coffey. \u201cUsually, your cruise ID card contains valuable information like the number for a 24-hour phone line.\u201d\nWatch how much you\u2019re drinking.\n\u201cDon\u2019t drink so much alcohol that you lose your wits,\u201d said Ashley Kosciolek, senior cruise writer at The Points Guy. \u201cIt could lead to slipping and falling or cause you to engage in unsafe behaviors. Plus, hangovers can really put a damper on the next day\u2019s fun.\u201d\nAlthough the side railings are generally quite high and secure, accidents happen \u2015 especially when people get too drunk.\n\u201cJust like at hotels during spring break, people have too many drinks and get an idea to try to move from one balcony to another or climb a railing to take a photo,\u201d Stewart said.\nOverindulging can lead to other dangerous incidents on cruises.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing more and more of these days is you\u2019re seeing a lot of fights breaking out on these ships,\u201d said David Charlip, a lawyer specializing in cruise ship injury litigation. \u201cPeople get drunk and, for whatever reason, have words with each other. A lot of people travel in big groups, so the next thing you know, you\u2019ve got a gang of people fighting another gang of people. We\u2019ve seen cases involving injuries, especially when the security staff intervenes.\u201d\nBe aware of your surroundings.\n\u201cBe aware of your surroundings \u2015 like looking out for slippery decks or anything along those lines,\u201d Pedrayes urged.\nUse your common sense as you make decisions, and trust your instincts if something doesn\u2019t feel right. Along the same lines, exercise the same caution around strangers and potentially dangerous situations on land.\n\u201cA cruise ship is like a small city,\u201d Ananias said. \u201cIt\u2019s filled with all different types of people, so you need to act accordingly.\u201d\nThere are usually signs that indicate crew-only areas. As a passenger, you should avoid these zones, which can be potentially dangerous. Even if a crew member invites you into a restricted area, you should politely decline.\n\u201cDo not invite other passengers to your room or share your cabin number with anyone outside of those you are traveling with,\u201d Fischer said.\nAnd just as you\u2019d be inclined to pay attention to your cocktail at a hotel bar or your beer at a local brewery, take the same approach with your drinks on a cruise. Date rape drugs can wind up in drinks on ships as well.\n\u201cEverything you do on land, you need to do on a ship,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBe protective of your drink a the bar. These sorts of instances are far fewer on a ship, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\nBe mindful of what you eat.\n\u201cA lot of times, people get intestinal illnesses like norovirus during cruise vacations,\u201d Charlip said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a good idea to wash your hands frequently, but other than that, there\u2019s not always a whole lot you can do. On excursions, you should pay attention like you would at a barbecue \u2015 if you see things made with mayonnaise like coleslaw that have been sitting out all day, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to eat them.\u201d\nIf you have specific dietary needs, check the cruise line\u2019s website or talk to a representative ahead of your trip to ensure they can be met on board.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to not share your food or beverages with passengers that you don\u2019t know and ensure good ventilation when indoors on the cruise to avoid contracting illness from another party on the cruise,\u201d Fischer said.\nDon\u2019t push past your limits.\n\u201cWhen people go on vacation, they often forget to pack their common sense and awareness,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cThey think accidents or bad incidents can\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s still the real world.\u201d\nRemember that you don\u2019t magically become a superhero when you embark.\n\u201cWhat happens on cruises is some people want to do things they haven\u2019t done for most of their lifetime, if not most of the year,\u201d Charlip said. \u201cSo they become more adventurous than perhaps their bodily limits allow and feel like they have to push themselves in many ways, whether it\u2019s trying to squeeze in as many activities as possible, braving heat or different environmental conditions, overeating, and drinking or just otherwise going above and beyond.\u201d\nTrying new things can be great, but remember you\u2019re on vacation and don\u2019t push past your limits, no matter how fun the rock climbing wall on the ship looks. If you book a tour or activity, take the time to understand what it entails and make sure you\u2019re prepared.\n\u201cParticularly in European countries, there may be a lot of walking, cobblestone streets, things like that,\u201d Charlip explained. \u201cA lot of these folks are somewhat elderly. If they\u2019re on a 10-day cruise, by day eight, they might be exhausted but still doing stuff that\u2019s terribly strenuous and active. They\u2019re not giving their bodies the chance to rest and recuperate. If you push it too much, you\u2019re opening yourself up to injury.\u201d\nUse the buddy system.\n\u201cRemain vigilant and be sure to stay with those you are traveling with both during the day and especially while moving around the ship at night,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIt\u2019s also best to carry your identification with you at all times in the event of an emergency.\u201d\nRefrain from going off by yourself during excursions when possible. Instead, consider designating someone in your group as your designated partner who has your back and ensures you\u2019re accounted for.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a solo cruiser, it could be beneficial to buddy up and ensure that someone on the ship has an eye out for you by making a friend or two early on,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cHowever, don\u2019t rely on this solely. Be sure to implement other practices to ensure your safety, such as putting valuables in your room safe, informing family or friends of your travel itinerary on the ship and on land, and always being aware of your surroundings.\u201d\nChildren should also never be left alone on a cruise or excursion.\n\u201cDon\u2019t allow your children to run around unsupervised,\u201d Kosciolek said. \u201cNot only is it potentially unsafe for them \u2015 it can be an annoyance to other passengers.\u201d\nProtect your belongings.\n\u201cMake sure your cabin doors lock when you enter or leave your rooms,\u201d Pedrayes said. \u201cUse the safe for valuables. If you have a balcony room, be careful with leaving things on the balcony. You wouldn\u2019t want it to get washed away in bad weather or with window washing.\u201d\nAs with other forms of travel, avoid walking around with large sums of money or valuables. There are ways to protect your belongings before you also arrive on the ship.\n\u201cI recommend putting AirTags or other tracking devices in your luggage,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cThings get lost and misplaced. Luggage tags pop off, even on cruise ships.\u201d\nStay on top of personal health and hygiene.\n\u201cIt is always important to make sure you are up to date with your routine\nvaccinations as well as the recommendations for the locations you plan to travel,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cMaking an appointment with a travel medicine specialist at least four weeks prior to your trip will mitigate risk.\u201d\nStay on top of personal hygiene practices, like regularly washing your hands throughout the vacation. Carry sanitizer as you go about your day as well.\n\u201cFrequent handwashing \u2015 especially before you eat and after you use the bathroom or touch things like stair rails or elevator buttons \u2015 is the best way to avoid both catching and spreading germs,\u201d Kosciolek said. \u201cAlthough cruise ships experience far fewer cases of norovirus than schools, hospitals, nursing homes and restaurants, it\u2019s still a risk.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget to pack any medicine you might need. Kosciolek recommended seasickness remedies like as ginger candies, Bonine or Dramamine, accupressure wristbands or behind-the-ear patches.\n\u201cIn a pinch, grab a green apple or a ginger ale from the buffet or room service,\u201d she added. \u201cFinding an area on a low deck near the middle of the ship also helps, as does finding a window and staring at the horizon.\u201d\nAlways take any essential medications with you on your excursions so that you have them even if there\u2019s an incident. Try to keep it all in its original packaging with prescription labels attached.\n\u201cIf you have chronic medical conditions, ensure you have all of your medications in a secure location plus an extra seven days of medication in the event there are any travel delays,\u201d Fischer added. \u201cTravelers should be encouraged to carry medications in hand luggage and avoid packing medications in luggage they will be required to check. Checked-in luggage can become lost or delayed, which will interrupt the traveler\u2019s regular administration regimes.\u201d\nDo your research.\nBefore you embark on your journey, familiarize yourself with any important policies and procedures in place. Understand what your travel insurance and health insurance do and don\u2019t cover.\n\u201cIf you have a heart attack or get into a traffic accident in an Uber or cab and wind up in the hospital during an excursion, you may not necessarily want to be at that particular hospital,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cFigure out what it would look like if you needed to be flown home too. And how would the costs be handled? Find out what medical care looks like on the cruise as well.\u201d\nFamiliarize yourself with your tour operators, as they\u2019d be responsible for any incidents and subsequent litigation.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that most of the official excursions are not run or managed by the cruise line,\u201d Charlip said. \u201cIt\u2019s typically outside vendors, so you might not have the same degree of oversight and supervision that you would in the U.S. And don\u2019t assume the cruise or tour staff will be looking out for your safety. The person that\u2019s primarily responsible for your safety is you, so do your homework.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also a proponent of trusting your gut. So, for example, you can decline if you signed up for a snorkeling expedition but think the sea conditions don\u2019t look good that day.\n\u201cFinally, make sure you have copies of all important documents, such as your passport, in case you lose it,\u201d Pedrayes said. \u201cI like to bring a paper photocopy, and I email myself a copy as well.\u201d\nEnsure someone back home has copies of your important information and itinerary. Then, have a plan of action if something goes wrong and you need help getting back home or reconnecting with the ship.\n\u201cBefore the cruise, read your contract,\u201d Ananias advised. \u201cLeave knowing exactly what will happen should there be an accident. Know that U.S. laws likely won\u2019t apply in many of these situations. You might feel like you\u2019re signing your life away, so everybody should read that contract and make sure they feel comfortable.\u201d", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passport-wait-times-backlog-delay_l_642eedb9e4b05cef00c7f961": "After three long pandemic years full of endless rapid tests and canceled trips, the travel industry is officially booming. According to late March data from the U.S. Travel Association, travel spending totaled $93 billion in February, which is 5% above 2019 levels and 9% above 2022 levels.\nWhile increased travel is good news for the global economy, the U.S. State Department is feeling the weight of all those newly booked flights. On March 23, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that due to an \u201cunprecedented demand for travel,\u201d people should expect wait times of about 10-13 weeks for a regular passport and 7-9 weeks for an expedited passport.\nThat\u2019s up to about four months from now for anyone who hasn\u2019t yet mailed or handed in their passport application.\nThis probably isn\u2019t welcome news if you need or have a passport expiring soon, especially if you have international summer travel coming up. With that in mind, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the current passport backlog issue \u2014 and what travel experts say you can do about it.\nWhy do you have to wait so long for a passport right now?\nThe passport wait time problem isn\u2019t exactly new. But when it first became clear that this was an issue in 2021 when people started traveling more, it was mostly because many passport facilities were still closed due to the pandemic, limiting in-person appointments, which are required for a handful of passport types.\nNow, it\u2019s related largely to demand and staffing shortages. \u201cWe\u2019re getting 500,000 applications a week for passports. That\u2019s 30-40% above last year,\u201d Blinken said. According to Sally French, lead travel writer at NerdWallet, this uptick in demand isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\n\u201cSo many people are taking the trips this year that they put on pause over the past few years,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201c[Because] most international borders are finally back open this year to foreign tourists, it\u2019s far easier to travel internationally than it has been at any point since the pandemic.\u201d\nAlthough Blinken said the State Department has hired more people to address this backlog, French noted that filling vacant positions post-pandemic hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\u201cJobs were lost across the whole travel industry in the early days of the pandemic, and \u2014 whether at hotels, theme parks or airports \u2014 it\u2019s been a struggle to refill now-vacant positions,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cThat\u2019s also the case at the State Department, which is saying its passport team members nationwide are clocking tens of thousands of hours of overtime a month to issue the millions of passports sought by traveling Americans. The State Department has said it is aggressively recruiting and hiring, and it has opened an additional satellite office.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to do right now to get your passport in time.\nIf this news has your heart pounding as you think about your meticulously planned wine and chocolate-filled European vacation going up in flames, try not to worry too much: There\u2019s a lot you can do to get ahead of this issue. Here are some tips.\n1. Check your passport\u2019s expiration date.\nFirst, find out when your passport actually expires \u2014 but know that a passport that expires six months from now isn\u2019t exactly a reason to breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cEven a passport that hasn\u2019t expired yet might not work, because some countries require passports to be valid at least six months beyond your trip dates,\u201d French said. \u201cSo, even if your passport doesn\u2019t expire until 2024, your late 2023 travel plans may be in jeopardy if your passport expires within six months of that trip.\u201d\nPeople planning to travel with younger family members should also pay special attention. \u201cIf you were 16 or older when your most recent passport was issued, your passport is valid for 10 years (it\u2019s valid for five years if you were under age 16 when your most recent passport was issued),\u201d French said. \u201cGiven that long period, it can be easy to forget when it\u2019s time for renewal \u2014 so glance at your passport now.\u201d\n2. Get all your paperwork together and be aware of restrictions.\nBefore attempting to renew or get a new passport, make sure you have all your paperwork in order so you aren\u2019t met with further delay. \u201cFill out the necessary paperwork and get your passport photo well ahead of your expected travel date,\u201d said Laura Lindsay, a travel expert at Skyscanner. \u201cAlso know that passport applications can no longer be submitted online if you did not start or submit an application on or before March 8. You will have to do it either by mail or in person. You can only renew it in person at a passport agency or center if you meet certain requirements.\u201d\n3. Be willing to pay to have your passport expedited.\nWhile expedited wait times aren\u2019t exactly speedy right now, they\u2019re better than standard wait times. But know that if you want to have your passport expedited, you\u2019ll need to pay at least $60.\nThe good news? If you\u2019re renewing your passport versus getting a new one, you can expect to get your passport, expedited or otherwise, a few weeks earlier. \u201cFor renewals, the timeline for expedited passports drops to 5-7 weeks,\u201d French said.\n4. Know that there are emergency options.\nThere are some cases where you can get a new passport ASAP.\n\u201cYou can get Life-or-Death Emergency Service and Urgent Travel Service,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cYou can choose a Life-or-Death Emergency Service if you have an emergency that requires international travel within 72 hours (three business days). If you have non-emergency international travel plans within five business days, you can opt for the Urgent Travel Service, where restrictions often apply. Walk-ins aren\u2019t allowed for either of these services.\u201d\n5. Even if your passport isn\u2019t expiring soon, just renew it.\nAll this to say: Even if your passport isn\u2019t expiring until 2024, or if you don\u2019t have a passport at all, you should probably start the process of renewing it or getting one. \u201cEven if you do not have any travel planned in the foreseeable future, it is best to have a passport on hand in case of an emergency and for easy identification purposes,\u201d Lindsay said.\nWhen will it all end?\nWhile the State Department is hiring more people to make up for the increase in passport application and renewal demands, French said there\u2019s no way to know when passport wait times will decrease \u2014 but it probably won\u2019t be soon.\n\u201cI wish I had a crystal ball and could predict the future for you. I will say that some of the State Department\u2019s estimated delays are longer than what they even were during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven that, I\u2019m not optimistic that passport delays will go away anytime soon. Certainly, they won\u2019t go away ahead of what\u2019s predicted to be a busy summer 2023 travel season.\u201d\nIs French\u2019s conclusion anxiety-inducing? Sure. But there\u2019s a lot you can do to get that shiny new passport in your hands a few months from now, versus six months from now. So take the advice of both French and Lindsay, and start the process now."}
